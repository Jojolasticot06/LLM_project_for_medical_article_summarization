Prediction of clinical response to corticosteroid or platelet-rich plasma injection in plantar fasciitis with MRI: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded study

1. Introduction
Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common condition and the leading cause of chronic heel pain [1]. The diagnosis of PF is often performed clinically when the patient presents with persistent plantar heel pain [1]. First-line PF treatment includes systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, orthosis, stretching and avoidance of excessive exercise if necessary, and a favorable clinical response is generally obtained within six weeks [2], [3], [4], [5]. Initial radiological assessment is seldom needed but is needed for patients with persistent symptoms that are not relieved by regular treatments. In this setting, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most informative imaging techniques [2,3,6].

The most common MRI findings in PF are thickening of the plantar fascia (> 4 mm), especially at its enthesis, and hypersignal on T2-weighted short TI inversion recovery images (HSTIR) of the fascia, perifascial soft tissues and calcaneal bone marrow. Those findings are related to inflammatory remodeling, usually involving microtrauma [3,7]. A second-line treatment such as corticosteroid (CS) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection is initiated when the diagnosis is confirmed [8].

CS injection is currently considered as a second-line treatment in patients with PF and persistent heel pain after at least three months of first-line treatment but this often leads to a high recurrence rate with a risk of rupture in 10% of patients [9]. Otherwise, PRP injections are increasingly used in the treatment of tendon, ligament and aponeurotic pathologies, especially in recurrent disease, tendon fissures and/or resistance to conventional treatments [4]. Yet the respective advantages and limitations of these two approaches have yet to be clearly elucidated. Some studies have revealed no significant differences in clinical results between patients treated with PRP and those treated by CS [5,[10], [11], [12]], while others found better efficacy of PRP over CS [13,14]. Finally, although MRI is the benchmark imaging examination for PF diagnosis, no studies have reported initial MRI criteria associated with a favorable clinical response to either of these treatments.

The purpose of this study was to identify association between MRI features and clinical data at baseline and six months following PRP or CS injection in patients with plantar fasciitis, and to identify initial MRI criteria associated with a favorable clinical response to treatment.

2. Materials and methods
This prospective, interventional, comparative, randomized and double-blinded clinical study was approved by the French South Mediterranean III Ethics Committee (2011-10-04 bis), and all patients gave informed consent. The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03857334) and funded by AOI CHU Montpellier (France).

2.1. Patient selection
Fifty patients with a clinical diagnosis of PF, meeting the inclusion criteria and without exclusion criteria were prospectively included between September 2013 and March 2017. (Table 1). Inclusion, exclusion and study exit criteria are listed in Table 1. These criteria were selected according to clinical recommendations for the diagnosis of PF described by McPoil et al. [15].

2.2. Intervention
After initial MRI examination, patients were randomly allocated into two groups to receive either PRP or CS via a dedicated secure software package (Ennov Clinical®). The randomization was balanced (1/1) and centralized.

The procedure consisted of ultrasound-guided periaponeurotic injection of autologous PRP or CS (cortivazol, Altim®, Sanofi-Aventis). The two patient groups were thereafter referred to as PRP group and CS group, respectively. The intervention was conducted within the first 15 days after initial MRI examination. The senior physician (M.J., with 18 years of clinical practice) performing the injection was not blinded, but used the same technique for each procedure.

PRP was obtained by collecting a sample of peripheral blood followed by two successive centrifugations using a GPS III Biomet® kit. For patients of both groups, a small amount of peripheral venous blood was sampled to ensure that the patients were actually blinded to treatment.

After skin disinfection, ultrasound-guided injection (LogiQ® P9, ML6–15 probe, General Electric Healthcare) was performed with a 21-G intramuscular needle without anesthesia. The PRP injection (2 mL) was intra- and peri‑aponeurotic while CS injection (1.5 mL) was only peri‑aponeurotic. In both groups, patients were asked to continue their first-line treatment.

For assessment of the clinical criteria, patients then had three follow-up visits with another senior physician (I.L., with 27 years of clinical practice) who was blinded with regard to the treatment group at one, three and six months. A second MRI examination was performed six months after PRP or CS injection.

The initial and 6-month MRI examinations were performed using a Magnetom® Aera 1.5 T MRI system (Siemens Healthineers) using a 16-channel boot antenna, and this included four acquisitions. Details on the MRI protocol are given in Table 2.


2.3. Outcome evaluation
2.3.1. Clinical evaluation
The clinical evaluation of all patients was conducted by the same practitioner (I.L.), while the ultrasound-guided injection was performed by a different one (M.J.). These practitioners were blinded with regard to the patient group.

Several clinical parameters were recorded at each visit and included pain visual analogic scale (VAS) for the first steps of the day; average daily pain VAS; maximal daily pain VAS; and functional impairment as measured by the foot functional index (FFI) [16].

The main clinical endpoint was a 50% or greater reduction in mean daily pain VAS six months after treatment, which represented a good clinical response.

2.3.2. Imaging evaluation
The MRI examinations were reviewed on the department's picture archiving and communication system (Centricity®, GE Healthcare). MRI examinations were independently analyzed by two senior musculoskeletal radiologists (A.B. and C.L., with 7- and 8 years of experience, respectively) who were blinded to the clinical and other imaging findings. One of them (A.B.) analyzed all MRI examinations twice for intra-observer agreement. In case of disagreement between the two radiologists, a third opinion from a senior radiologist was obtained.

MRI examinations were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively (Fig. 1). The quantitative analysis included: maximal thickness of plantar aponeurosis on STIR sequences measured in sagittal and coronal planes; intra-aponeurotic signal intensity on T2-weighted STIR images by placing two elliptical tags on regions of interest (5–20 mm²): one on the aponeurosis, at maximum hypersignal, and the second in the talus (dome) outside the inflammatory region. An aponeurosis-to-talus ratio was obtained on the basis of these values. The qualitative analysis included deep soft tissue HSTIR measured on sagittal sequences and classified as absent (0) or present (1). Calcaneal bone marrow HSTIR, as measured on sagittal images, was ranked from 0 to 3 depending on whether it was absent (0), extending to <5 mm (1), between 5 and 10 mm (2) or >10 mm (3) relative to the calcaneal enthesis of the plantar fascia. For statistical analysis, it was further classified as absent (0) or present (1, 2 or 3); superficial soft tissue HSTIR next to the plantar fascia, as measured on sagittal sequences, was classified into absent (0) or present (1).


2.4. Statistical analysis
Quantitative data were expressed as means ± standard deviations (SD) and ranges and qualitative data were expressed as raw numbers, proportions and percentages. Differences in categorical variables between the two groups were searched using Chi-square or Fisher exact test. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to assess normality in distribution of continuous variables. Student t-test or Mann Whitney U test were used to search for differences in quantitative variables.

Inter-observer reliability was estimated using a two-way mixed-model intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous variables and weighted Kappa test was for qualitative MRI variables [17].

Correlations between clinical and MRI data and between relative clinical variations and initial MRI data were searched using Spearman correlation test. Correlations were classified according to r values as moderate for r between 0.40 and 0.59, strong for r between 0.60 and 0.79, and very strong for r between 0.80 and 0.99.

Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Youden index were used to determine the appropriate cut-off value of the initial coronal thickness of the plantar fascia (IFTCP) to predict the clinical results of the CS injection group.

The statistical bilateral significance threshold was set at 5%. All analyses were carried out using the SAS® Enterprise Guide software package (version 7.12), and graphs were generated using R statistical software (www.r-project.org, version 3.6.2) with the ggplot2 package (version 3.2.1).

3. Results
Among the 50 enrolled patients, two left the study at baseline (one per group), and six were lost to follow-up (three per group). Of these 42 patients, four had incomplete or off-site MRI examinations that could not be retrieved. A total of 38 patients (20 in the PRP group and 18 in the CS group) were included in the MRI study (Fig. 2).


3.1. Clinical outcome
No differences in gender, age, baseline pain VAS score, baseline FFI, and medical, surgical or therapeutic history were found between the two groups (Table 3). Regarding the primary clinical endpoint, no significant differences in good clinical response rates were found between the PRP group (71%; 15/21) and the CS group (52%; 11/21) (P = 0.20). There was a difference between the two groups for relative variation in daily maximum pain VAS between baseline and 6 months of -65 ± 46 (SD)% (range: -100–66.7) for the PRP group and -45 ± 35 (SD)% (range: -100–28.6) for the CS group (P = 0.02). No significant differences in relative variation of mean pain VAS score at six months was observed between PRP group (-68 ± 48 [SD]%; range: -100–100) and CS group (-48 ± 44 [SD]%; range: -100–55.6) (P = 0.08).


3.2. MRI outcome
High inter- and intra-observer agreement was observed for quantitative and qualitative variables (Table 4).

3.2.1. Pre-treatment
No significant differences in initial MRI characteristics were found between the two groups (Table 3). Within the overall population, there was a significant association between deep soft tissue HSTIR and high pain VAS for the first steps of the day (P = 0.03) and between calcaneal bone marrow HSTIR and high pain VAS for the first steps of the day (P < 0.01) (Table 5).


In the CS group, a moderate correlation between the coronal thickness of the plantar fascia and high pain VAS for the first steps of the day was noted (r = 0.51; P = 0.03) as well as for the total FFI (r = 0.48; P = 0.046), whereas no significant pre-treatment correlation was found for the PRP group.

3.2.2. Post-treatment
In the CS group, there was a significant decrease in mean intra-aponeurotic HSTIR ratio compared to the initial MRI (Initial HSTIR ratio = 1.36 ± 0.84; 6 months HSTIR ratio = 0.87 ± 0.70; difference = -0.28 ± 0.43 [SD]; P = 0.01). There were no other significant variations in MRI criteria in either group compared to the initial MRI examination, notably no significant decrease in mean plantar fascia thickness between 0 and six months (-0.02 mm ± 0.20 [SD]; P = 0.15). The relative variations in MRI criteria did not reveal any significant differences between the two groups after treatment (Table 6).


Clinical findings were not significantly associated to MRI findings at six months after treatment for any of the measured outcomes in the individual groups or the total population. However, some variations in clinical outcomes between 0 and six months associated with variations on MRI examination. For instance, an increase in calcaneal bone marrow HSTIR was associated with poor clinical outcome at six months as defined by mean pain VAS decrease ≤ 50% in the PRP group (P = 0.01). Moreover, the decrease in coronal fascia thickness strongly correlated with a good clinical outcome at 6 months as evidenced by a decrease in mean pain VAS score and total FFI in the CS group (r = 0.70 and r = 0.71, respectively; P < 0.01).

Differences were noted between groups regarding initial MRI criteria predictive of a good clinical response. In the PRP group, no predictive criteria of good clinical response at 6 months were found for quantitative or semi-quantitative criteria. In the CS group, the IFTCP strongly correlated with 6-month clinical improvement for VAS score (r =-0.61 P < 0.01) and moderately for total FFI (r = -0.55; P < 0.05). There was a moderate association between the initial HSTIR ratio and the total FFI at 6 months (r = 0.51; P = 0.029). The initial calcaneal bone marrow HSTIR was significantly associated to a good clinical outcome at 6 months on the total FFI (P < 0.01).

On the basis of the strong correlation obtained between the IFTCP and pain VAS variation in the CS group, a ROC curve was plotted to identify the IFTCP cut-off value predictive of a good response (≥ 50% decrease in mean pain VAS score) to CS treatment (Fig. 3). In the CS group, the cut-off value for IFTCP that maximized the AUC was > 7 mm (sensitivity = 60% [6/10]; specificity = 100% [8/8]; Youden index = 0.6; AUC = 0.875 [95% CI: 0.708–1]). An IFTCP > 7 mm indicated good response to CS treatment, with 100% (8/8) of patients with IFTCP > 7 mm showing good clinical response at 6 months and only 33% (4/12) of those with IFTCP ≤ 7 mm on initial MRI showing good clinical response at 6 months (P = 0.007).


In the PRP group, this cut-off value for IFTCP yielded 43% sensitivity (6/14) and 50% specificity (3/6) to predict good clinical response (AUC = 0.619; 95% CI: 0.462–0.724). In patients with an IFTCP > 7 mm on initial MRI, 67% showed good clinical response at 6 months and only 73% of those with an IFTCP ≤ 7 mm on initial MRI showed good clinical response at 6 months (P = 0.36).

4. Discussion
Our study shows that a high initial fascia thickness is predictive of a good clinical response at six months for CS treatment, while a low thickness was predictive of a poor clinical response in the long-term follow up. To our knowledge, this is the first study that identifies MRI variables associated with a good or poor clinical response after infiltrative treatment. We found that an IFTCP > 7 mm on the pretreatment MRI examination was associated with good clinical response at 6 months in 100% of patients who received CS compared to only 33% for those with IFTCP ≤ 7 mm). This association was not found for patients who had received PRP injections, with a good clinical response in most of patients, regardless of the initial fascia thickness. These findings led us to consider using this cut-off in treatment selection for patients responding poorly to first-line therapy, while opting for CS therapy in patients with an initial aponeurotic thickness > 7 mm, while opting for PRP therapy in others.

PRP injections are increasingly used in musculoskeletal medicine to treat various pathologies. For instance, Guenoun et al. and Filippiadis et al. respectively documented the effectiveness of PRP treatment in patients with degenerative meniscal tear and knee osteoarthritis [18,19]. Our results are consistent with those of previous studies that confirmed the effectiveness of both CS and PRP injections in second-line treatment of plantar fasciitis [12,20,21]. They also confirmed that other second-line treatments may be as effective as local infiltrations As also previously reported, the clinical follow-up of patients in our study revealed a decrease in mean pain six months after treatment in both groups [13,22,23]. Yet in our study we noted a difference in favor of PRP injection that was not significant for mean pain VAS (P = 0.08), but was significant for maximal pain intensity (P = 0.02). Several studies suggested that this finding could be related to the cicatrizing and fibrosing activity of PRP, as opposed to the anti-inflammatory action of CS [12,[24], [25], [26], [27]]. There was good inter- and intra-observer agreement for all measurements, thus confirming, that MRI is a reliable diagnostic tool and that the results are highly reproducible in this plantar fasciitis [28].

In the CS group, there was a significant decrease in aponeurotic hypersignal (as measured by the HSTIR ratio) after treatment and a close association between the coronal plantar fascia thickness decrease and the good clinical response, which was not noted in the PRP group. This was likely related to the differing mechanisms of action between the two treatments, including a reduction in locoregional inflammatory processes for CS therapy, resulting in a thinner aponeurosis with a decrease in HSTIR [24,25] and, for PRP, aponeurotic fiber repair via fibro-conjunctive tissue replacement, resulting in an almost unchanged aponeurotic thickness after treatment [26,27,[29], [30], [31]]. No other criteria were significantly associated with a good clinical response upon post-treatment MRI in either group. This suggests that MRI is of little value for follow-up examination after infiltration [32]. A study by Gamba et al. concluded that there were no correlations between the initial plantar fascia thickness and the clinical symptomatology in patients with fasciitis resistant to initial treatment, which was consistent with our findings [33].

Overall, significant results were obtained for measurement in the coronal plane of the plantar fascia, but not for measurement the sagittal plane. This may be related to the less precise and reproducible measurements in the sagittal plane and also to the small size of the central aponeurosis by comparison with that on sagittal plane, leading to a limited number of slices passing through the aponeurosis. In addition, the sagittal MRI slice orientation was not always strictly perpendicular to the aponeurosis, which hampered reliable measurement. MRI aponeurosis thickness measurements should therefore always be performed in the coronal plane whenever possible.

The small sample size and absence of control group were limitations of our study and probably accounted for the difference in initial MRI-clinical associations between groups. Despite the small number of patients, significant results were obtained on the main clinical endpoint and criterion associated with good clinical response was identified with regard to corticosteroid injections on initial MRI. In addition, a longer follow-up should be considered (1–2 years) for further investigations so as to be able to confirm the clinical response sustainability, as in the study of Jiménez-Pérez et al. (mean follow-up of 33 months) [22]. A subsidiary study is underway to confirm the cut-off value suggested by AUC analysis of this first study, with a larger cohort and a longer follow-up in order to avoid potential study bias.

In conclusion, PRP injections are effective in approximately two-thirds of patients with PF regardless fascial thickness. However, with CS injections, a marked initial aponeurotic thickness was closely associated with a favorable clinical response at six months. This study therefore suggests that the therapeutic plan should be oriented towards second-line treatment in these patients based on this threshold. Furthermore, the absence of post-therapeutic radioclinical correlations suggests that MRI as limited utility for the follow-up of patients with PF after infiltrative treatment.
