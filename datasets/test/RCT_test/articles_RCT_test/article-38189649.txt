Determinants of Subjective Mental and Functional Health of Critical Illness Survivors: Comparing Pre-ICU and Post-ICU Status

ICU survivors frequently suffer from impairments of cognition (1), physical function (2), and mental health (3–6). This nexus is commonly referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) (7). The prevalence of impairments related to the PICS domains is well described (1,5,6,8). The occurrence of new PICS impairments after ICU discharge, however, has been studied far less. In particular, patients’ pre-ICU health status has been frequently overlooked. Yet, evidence is accumulating that ICU patients commonly show impairments already before admission (9–11) and that critical illness acts as an external stressor contributing to further health decline (9,10,12). A poor pre-ICU status has also been linked to poor functional outcomes (13,14).

PICS-related impairments correspond to a low health-related quality of life (HrQoL) among ICU survivors (15,16). Due to the unpredictable nature of an ICU admission, the prospective collection of pre-ICU HrQoL data is challenging. Previous studies have examined pre-ICU HrQoL retrospectively by asking patients at ICU admission or thereafter to recall previous HrQoL. These studies show pre-ICU HrQoL was already lower than in comparable populations (15–18) and that poor pre-ICU HrQoL (19–22) and preexisting comorbidities (22,23) were predictive of poor HrQoL after ICU discharge.

HrQoL after critical illness has most commonly been assessed using the generic Short-Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) or the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) (15,16). As part of a PICS measurement instrument set, we introduced two short items to assess HrQoL in critical illness survivors (24). Patients rated their mental and functional health status on a scale from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). Advantages over other HrQoL instruments include their brevity, the separation of mental and functional health, which may show diverging trajectories after critical illness (16), and the conjunction with the assessment of specific mental and functional health concerns (25). In a validation study, we demonstrated that these items correlate well with the EQ-5D-5L (25).

The two items on subjective mental and functional health have not been used to assess ICU survivors’ pre-ICU health status. It is also unknown which factors determine a decline or an improvement in subjective mental or functional health after ICU discharge. The aims of this study were, first, to compare patients’ pre-ICU health status with their post-ICU health status. Second, we aimed at identifying demographic and illness-related patient characteristics associated with either a decline or an improvement of subjective mental or functional health.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Characteristics, Inclusion Criteria, and Ethics
We present a hypothesis-driven analysis of data from the multicenter, stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled Enhanced Recovery after Intensive Care (ERIC) trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03671447) (26,27). ERIC was approved by the institutional review board of Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (EA1/006/18; January 26, 2018) and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 in its most recent amendment from 2013 (28). Ten clusters of ICUs in Berlin and the neighboring federal state of Brandenburg, Germany, enrolled patients with an expected ICU length of stay (LOS) of greater than or equal to 24 hours in a medical, surgical, or mixed ICU, who were 18 years old or older, and had German statutory health insurance coverage. Patients or legal representatives consented to study participation. In this analysis, we included patients who were discharged alive and completed at least one of two post-ICU follow-ups.

Post-ICU Follow-Ups
Follow-up examinations were targeted at 3 and 6 months after ICU discharge and focused on PICS-related impairments. Following a validated instrument set (24), patients completed tests pertaining to their cognition, mental health, physical function, disability, HrQoL, and subjective health (Table S1, https://links.lww.com/CCM/H471). Follow-up examinations were conducted by trained study personnel (i.e., research assistants, medical doctors, study nurses, and psychologists in training). Patients either visited the study center or received home visits. Few patients received phone-based follow-ups.

Subjective Mental and Functional/Physical Health Status
Patients were asked to rank their mental and functional/physical health status in the previous week on two separate visual analog scales from 0 (worst) to 10 (best) (24). We also asked patients to retrospectively rank their mental and functional health status before ICU admission on two separate visual analog scales from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). The accuracy of a retrospective assessment of pre-ICU HrQoL was validated in a previous study on patients with preplanned ICU admissions (29). Pre-ICU data from the first available follow-up went into analysis, as a retrospective assessment after 3 months was shown to be more accurate than a retrospective assessment after 6 months (29).

Covariates
We employed covariates of demographics, biometrics, and severity of illness that were previously shown to affect HrQoL in ICU survivors (16,18,30–33). We collected demographic and biometric data, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, ICU admission date, and admission reason at study enrollment; results from routine delirium screening during ICU treatment; and the duration of mechanical ventilation and the ICU LOS at ICU discharge. During follow-ups, we collected the following: living in a partnership/marriage, highest education, and the number of organ systems with comorbidities before ICU admission (defined as the pulmonary system, the metabolic system, the kidneys and urogenital system, the cardiovascular system, the CNS, and/or the bones, joints, and muscles).

Statistical Analysis
Data from follow-up assessments with at least one pair of pre-ICU and post-ICU subjective health status (mental and/or functional health) were analyzed. Patients contributed data from either one or two follow-ups. Continuous variables are presented as mean (sd) and median (interquartile range [IQR]). Categorical variables are shown as absolute (n) and relative (%) frequencies. Characteristics of patients with one follow-up and patients with two follow-ups are compared using Mann-Whitney U tests and Pearson’s χ2 tests. Timing of follow-ups was visualized using histograms. Subjective mental and functional health before ICU admission and at the follow-ups were compared using descriptive statistics, violin plots, Spearman rank correlation coefficients, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

As we did not have a suitable external anchor available, we determined the relevant difference of the subjective health items using a distribution-based approach (34,35). We defined a subjective health change of at least ± 1 sd as a relevant decline/improvement. Given a sd of 2.9 points for mental health and 3.2 points for functional health among the first follow-ups, we considered a change of at least three points as a relevant decline/improvement. In sensitivity analyses, we also considered a change of at least two points as relevant decline/improvement.

We used mixed-effects logistic regression models to identify factors associated with a decline or improvement in mental and/or functional health. Most patients received two assessments (mean: 1.7 assessments). To account for the clustered nature of our observations as additional source of variance, our models included a random effect for the unique patient identification number (patient ID). Independent fixed-effects variables included: age, gender, body mass index, time between ICU discharge and follow-up, SAPS II at admission, delirium (yes/no), ICU LOS, duration of mechanical ventilation, living in a partnership or marriage (yes/no), university degree (yes/no), and number of organ systems with comorbidities before admission. The dependent variable was either a relevant decline or improvement in mental or functional health. We report rho (ρ) of each model, which depicts the proportion of the total variance contributed by the patient-level variance component, and employed likelihood-ratio tests to compare the mixed-effects models with models without random effect. Independent variables, which were significantly associated with a decline of subjective health in univariable regression models were included in multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models. In postestimations, we visualized the probability of a decline of subjective health dependent on the ICU LOS. In sensitivity analyses, we employed mixed-effects ordered logistic regression models to determine factors associated with an absolute mental or functional health change, independent of defining a relevant health change. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. Analyses were carried out using Stata17 SE (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX).

RESULTS
Characteristics of the Study Population
Of 1463 patients enrolled in the ERIC trial (27), 1304 patients were discharged from the ICU alive; 226 patients died before the first follow-up. Of 855 patients who received at least one follow-up, 623 patients were followed up twice and 232 were followed up once (Fig. S1, https://links.lww.com/CCM/H471). We collected 1478 follow-ups in total, which took place after a median of 161 days (IQR, 93–200 d). First follow-ups took place after a median of 97 days (IQR, 83–131.5 d), and second follow-ups after a median of 196 days (IQR, 179–232 d) (Fig. S2, https://links.lww.com/CCM/H471). Patients had a median ICU LOS of 5 days (IQR, 2–10 d) and a median admission SAPS II of 29 (IQR, 17–42). Almost two-thirds of the patients were mechanically ventilated, and about one third had at least one episode of delirium (Table 1).

Subjective Mental and Functional Health Before ICU Admission and at Follow-Ups
On a scale from 0 (worst) to 10 (best), patients rated their mental health before ICU admission with 8 (median, IQR, 5–9; mean, 6.8; sd, 2.8). At their first follow-up, the median rating was 7 (IQR, 5–9; mean, 6.6; sd, 2.5; p < 0.001 compared with pre-ICU). While 65% (n = 543/841) reported no relevant change in mental health, 16% (n = 133/841) reported an improvement, and 20% (n = 165/841) outlined a mental health decline. At their second follow-up, the share of patients reporting a decline (19%; n = 114/616) or improvement (18%, n = 113/616) remained relatively stable (Fig. 1 and Table 2; and Table S2, Fig. S3, and Fig. S4 [https://links.lww.com/CCM/H471]).

Patients rated their functional health before ICU admission with 7 (median, IQR, 4–9; mean, 6.4; sd, 2.9). Functional health ratings decreased to a median of 6 (IQR, 4–8; mean, 5.7; sd, 2.3; p < 0.001 compared with pre-ICU) at their first follow-up. More than half of patients (54%, n = 456/849) reported no relevant change, whereas about one third (30%, n = 256/849) reported a functional health decline, and 16% (n = 137/849) reported an improvement. At the second follow-up, the share of patients describing a functional health decline decreased to 24% (n = 151/623) and the percentage reporting an improvement increased to 19% (n = 121/623).

Determinants of a Decline or Improvement in Subjective Mental and/or Functional Health
The ICU LOS, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and an episode of delirium were significantly associated with a decline in mental (odds ratio [OR] per ICU day, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02–1.05; p < 0.001; OR per ventilation hour, 1.001; 95% CI, 1.001–1.002; p < 0.001; and OR for delirium, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.06–2.55; p = 0.027) and functional health (OR per ICU day, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03–1.07; p < 0.001; OR per ventilation hour, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.001–1.003; p < 0.001; and OR for delirium, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.20–3.48; p = 0.008). Conversely, age decreased the odds of a mental health decline (OR per year, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.97–0.99; p = 0.004), and the odds of a functional health decline decreased over time after discharge (OR per month, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.94; p = 0.001) (Table 3; and Table S3, https://links.lww.com/CCM/H471).


In multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression, the ICU LOS remained significantly associated with a decline in mental (OR per ICU day, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00–1.09; p = 0.038) and functional health (OR per ICU day, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01–1.12; p = 0.026) after adjusting for other covariates. Postestimation showed that the probability of a mental health decline increased from 15% at an ICU LOS of 1 day to 29% at an ICU LOS of 30 days. The probability of a functional health decline increased from 22% at an ICU LOS of 1 day to 41% at an ICU LOS of 30 days. The probability of mental and functional health decline exceed 50% at a LOS of 62 and 42 days, respectively. Age was associated with lower odds of a mental health decline (OR per year, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96–0.99; p = 0.003), and the odds of a functional health decline decreased over time after discharge (OR per month, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79–0.94; p = 0.001) (Table 4 and Fig. 2).


Our sensitivity analyses also showed that ICU LOS and the time of the follow-up after ICU discharge were significantly associated with a change in subjective health. We also found an association between the number of affected organ systems before ICU admission with functional health (Tables S4–S8 and Fig. S5, https://links.lww.com/CCM/H471).

DISCUSSION
Main Findings
In this secondary analysis of a large multicenter trial in Germany, we compared subjective mental and functional health of 855 patients before ICU admission and after discharge. While more than half of patients did not report substantial changes in their subjective functional or mental health, we found that one in five patients reported a mental health decline and at least one in four patients reported a functional health decline. The ICU LOS was strongly associated with a health decline: Compared with patients with an ICU LOS of 1 day, patients with an ICU LOS of 30 days had a 97% higher probability of a mental health decline (15% vs. 29%) and an 88% higher probability of a functional health decline (22% vs. 41%).

What Is Already Known
Past studies have highlighted reductions in HrQoL following critical illness (15,16,18,36), commonly assessed using SF-36 and EQ-5D (15,16,18,36). EQ-5D index values were shown to correspond well to the subjective mental and functional health ratings used in this study (25). Previous studies either anchored their HrQoL estimates with a reference non-ICU population or asked participants to retrospectively report their HrQoL before ICU admission (15). These studies showed that pre-ICU HrQoL was lower than in the matched general population (15). For example, it has been previously shown in a Dutch prospective cohort study that pre-ICU HrQoL (using SF-36) in ICU survivors was lower than in an age-matched Dutch general population (37,38). This suggests that many ICU patients already have preexisting health impairments before admission. In addition, previous studies showed that HrQoL partially recovered after discharge from the ICU, particularly in physical health domains (15,16,18). Consistent with this finding, our analysis indicated that with increasing time after discharge, patients were the less likely to report a functional health decline.

We identified distinct patient cohorts with unchanged, improved, or declined mental and/or functional health. This reflects a Dutch study where mental and physical SF-36 summary scores remained unchanged after 1 year for medical ICU patients, decreased for urgent surgical patients, but improved for elective surgical patients (12). In another Portuguese study, only 17% of 275 ICU survivors reported an unchanged health state compared with before, but 54% reported an improvement (39). The difference to our findings may be explained by our definition of a minimum relevant difference of three points.

Our analysis revealed that ICU LOS was significantly related to a mental and functional health decline, aligning with studies from Portugal (39) and Belgium (40), but contrasting other findings (41). A review from 2005 (18) concluded that only one (42) of eight studies analyzing the impact of ICU LOS on HrQoL found a significant association. Higher age appeared to be protective against a mental but not functional health decline. Previous studies on the impact of age on HrQoL after critical illness found diverging results (16,18,22,23). Conflicting results may be explained by the finding that physical rather than mental health items drive a negative effect of age on HrQoL (43), and by a possible U-shaped association of age and mental health (44): That is, the rate of depressive symptoms in the general population decreases until the early 60s/70s, and increases again for older individuals (44). Given our median age of 67 (IQR, 56–77), we may detect the protective effect of age on mental health described in the general population (44,45). In an aging ICU population, where age is associated with increased mortality (46,47), research on the influence of age on health outcomes is of utmost importance. Severity of illness and duration of mechanical ventilation were not associated with subjective health in multivariable analyses, mirroring previous results (23).

What This Study Adds
Although follow-up of ICU survivors and HrQoL measurement is recommended (48,49), only few patients receive follow-ups (50–54). Study protocols often state the planned time of follow-ups, but actual assessment times frequently remain unknown. We showed that the time of follow-ups has an impact on the functional health status. Hence, the timing of follow-ups has to be considered in post-ICU clinics and should be transparently reported in studies. Patients with a long ICU LOS are at particular risk of impaired HrQoL. Thus, tailored follow-up assessments in ICU follow-up clinics and primary care should focus on these groups. As patients may trivialize or overemphasize symptoms, the administration of a proxy evaluation by a caregiver could provide a complimentary perspective and give additional, supplementary information (55).

Strengths and Limitations
We present a secondary analysis from a large German multicenter trial with a representative cohort of surgical and medical ICU patients. We collected pre-ICU and post-ICU HrQoL of almost 80% of patients who survived until 8 months after discharge. Our study also comes with limitations. First, our data could have been skewed by a survivor bias. That is, we could not include patients who passed away before their assessments and patients who withdrew from the study, who may have had worse health than follow-up participants. Second, we assessed pre-ICU health by retrospectively asking patients, so our assessments may have been subject to recall bias. However, retrospective assessments of pre-ICU HrQoL have been commonly used in previous studies (15). Further, another study compared EQ-5D scores that were assessed before a planned ICU admission with EQ-5D scores that were recalled after 3 and 6 months. The authors found high levels of agreement between actual and recalled assessments (29), although this approach has only been validated for elective but not for unplanned ICU admissions. Third, patients were recruited in Berlin and the neighboring federal state of Brandenburg. Recruitment in a limited geographical region with high quality of healthcare and healthcare access poses limitations to external generalizability to more rural regions, areas with fewer resources, and areas with more difficult healthcare access. Nevertheless, considering the broad inclusion criteria, the study cohort comprised medical and surgical ICU patients, which had a variety of admission diagnoses and were enrolled in small, medium-sized, and large hospitals. Fourth, we used the sd as a distribution-based method to justify our minimal important subjective health difference. Anchor-based methods are generally recommended over distribution-based methods, so future studies should use external anchors. Nevertheless, sensitivity analyses with a minimal important subjective health difference of two points and ordered logistic regression, which does not require defining a relevant health change, showed results similar to our main analysis. Finally, we did not systematically assess if patients suffered from preexisting mental health conditions. These patients may have already had lower pre-ICU mental health ratings and may have also faced greater mental health declines after ICU discharge than healthy individuals.

CONCLUSIONS
More than half of 855 critical illness survivors did not show substantial mental or functional health changes, but about one in five patients experienced a mental health decline, and at least one in four patients experienced a functional health decline. Multivariable mixed-effects logistic regressions showed that longer ICU LOS increased the likelihood of a subjective health decline. With increasing age, the likelihood of a mental health decline decreased, and with increasing time after discharge, the likelihood of a functional health decline decreased. Post-ICU care in post-ICU clinics and primary care should focus on patients with extended ICU LOS, as this group is particularly susceptible for subjective health decline.
