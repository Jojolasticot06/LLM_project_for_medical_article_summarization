Effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy for invasive group A Streptococcus infection: A Japanese nationwide observational study

Introduction
Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a gram-positive, beta-hemolytic coccus. It can cause various diseases, ranging from mild illnesses (such as pharyngitis and impetigo) to severe illnesses (such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [STSS]). Invasive GAS (iGAS) infection is defined as the isolation of GAS from sterile sites including the blood, pleura, and cerebrospinal fluid [1].
The inclusion of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) in iGAS treatment is based on the fundamental premise that the notable inflammatory response caused by the infection leads to systemic toxicity and multiorgan failure. This heightened immune reaction is caused by a combination of host factors, including genetic susceptibility and absence of prior immunity to GAS, as well as pathogenic attributes, such as the expression of specific M proteins, DNases, and superantigens [2]. The efficiency of IVIG for GAS has been demonstrated in in vitro and mouse experimental models, which reported that IVIG can neutralize superantigens and reduce the systemic inflammatory response [3,4]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of IVIG treatment in patients with iGAS has been investigated in several studies [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Although some studies have shown that IVIG treatment is associated with increased survival, there is insufficient evidence to support its effectiveness due to the substantial influence of confounding factors.
Through careful adjustment for background factors between the IVIG-treated group and control group, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of IVIG treatment in the survival of patients with iGAS.
Methods
Study design
This retrospective cohort study evaluated the effectiveness of IVIG in improving the survival of patients with iGAS. It was conducted using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC) database, a case-mix patient classification system built with the aim of an electronic payment system and to increase hospital performance transparency [11]. More than 1800 hospitals, including 82 academic hospitals, participated in establishing this database in 2014. This database includes the claims data of each drug administered, the procedure performed, and the care provided to the hospitalized patients. It is structured using the following components: diagnoses, type of admission, surgical procedures, and patient background, including sex, age, and body weight. The 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) was used to record the diagnoses [12].
The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University (#788; April 2020). The requirement for informed consent was waived owing to the retrospective nature of the study and the use of anonymized data.
Study population
The study comprised 508 patients with iGAS treated in DPC-participating hospitals between April 01, 2015, and March 31, 2021. Of these patients, 481 who were treated between April 01, 2018 and March 31, 2021 were included in the main analysis; meanwhile, sensitivity analysis was performed using the data of the remaining patients. Patients with sepsis caused by GAS who were admitted to an intensive care unit were included in the study. To ensure better cohort homogeneity, (i) patients with missing data on any of the variables analyzed, (ii) patients aged <16 years, (iii) pregnant women, (iv) patients who were discharged within 2 days after admission, and (v) patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were excluded. To mitigate the potential for immortal time bias, we excluded patients who were discharged within the first 2 days of their admission. This is because we adjusted for patient severity by considering the intensity of treatments administered within the initial 2 days of their admission.
Data collection
The inclusion criterion included patients admitted to an intensive care unit with a diagnosis of “sepsis due to group A Streptococcus” (A40.0) who tested positive for a sterile site isolate. The sterile sites included blood, fascia, cerebrospinal fluid, pleura, ascitic fluid, synovial fluid, and retroperitoneal abscess. The following data were also collected: concurrent diagnoses on admission; post-admission complications, including necrotizing fasciitis, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus; age; sex; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score; length of hospital stay; patient's discharge status; procedures (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and debridement) performed within 2 days after admission; and drugs, including IVIG, clindamycin, insulin, furosemide, hydrocortisone, and vasopressors (norepinephrine, epinephrine, or vasopressin), administered within 2 days after admission. STSS was diagnosed based on the ICD-10 code for “toxic shock syndrome” (A48.3). Data on hospital characteristics, including the number of beds and whether the hospital is affiliated with a university, were also collected.
Outcomes
The IVIG group included patients who received IVIG treatment within 2 days after admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, whereas the secondary outcomes were 30-day and 7-day mortality rates after admission. Patients who were discharged alive were included in the surviving group.
Statistical analysis
Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for the severity of iGAS between the IVIG and control groups. Age, body mass index, sex, level of consciousness, interventions performed within 2 days after admission (renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation), concentration of vasopressors used (norepinephrine and dobutamine), presence/absence of necrotizing fasciitis, and whether hydrocortisone was administered were included as covariates. The covariates were selected based on the results of previous studies [6,7,9]. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated to screen for multicollinearity, with a tolerance value of <2. The predictive model was established using 70% of the randomly selected cohort, and its accuracy was evaluated using the remaining 30% of the patients. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to determine the accuracy of the predictive model, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was conducted to assess the goodness of fit. Propensity score matching was used to perform a sensitivity analysis. The adopted algorithm used was 1:1 K-nearest neighbor matching without replacement, and the matching caliper width was set at 0.2 multiplied by the standard deviation of the logit-transformed propensity score. Chi-square test was used to compare the outcomes of propensity score-matched participants between the two groups. Two subgroup analyses were performed in patients who received clindamycin and in those diagnosed with STSS, respectively. Additionally, sensitivity analyses were conducted (1) using the methods adopted in the primary investigation of the data obtained between 2015 and 2018, (2) comparing patients who received early IVIG treatment on admission with those who did not, and (3) using a generalized linear mixed model with the variables “number of beds” and “whether the hospital is affiliated with a university” treated as mixed effects. Initial sensitivity analyses were conducted as the timing of COVID-19 pandemic coincided with the period of the study; moreover, changes in patients’ demographics and healthcare systems may have confounded the effect of IVIG treatment on the outcomes of individuals with iGAS. Accordingly, we aimed to explore whether the periods before and after the pandemic should be considered confounding factors by comparing the results between 2015 and 2018 and 2018 and 2021. Python 3.8.6 (Python Software Foundation) was used to perform all statistical analyses.
Results
During the study period, sepsis caused by GAS was diagnosed in 1392 patients. Of the total patients, 538 were included in the study. Of these patients, 57 patients who were discharged within 48 h of admission (n = 36), with missing values (n = 4), aged <16 years (n = 12), and were pregnant (n = 5) were excluded. The main analysis was performed in 481 patients, and the sensitivity analysis measured the treatment effect in 158 sets of propensity score-matched patients. Fig. 1 shows the patient selection process. The demographic characteristics of the patients included in the analysis were as follows: median age, 65 years (interquartile range [IQR], 54-75 years); female sex, 49.7% (239/481); median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, 8 (IQR 7-10); necrotizing fasciitis, 55.9% (269/481); and clindamycin treatment, 65.1% (313/481). The median dosage of IVIG in the IVIG treatment group was 20.0 g (IQR 10.0-27.5 g). Most patients were treated with the combination of clindamycin and penicillin or the combination of clindamycin and other wide spectrum antibiotics including carbapenem, fourth generation cephalosporins, or tazobactam/piperacillin. It is also noteworthy that linezolid was substitutively used in some patients as an adjunctive of clindamycin. The overall mortality rate was 31.0% (149/481). Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the IVIG-treated group and control group. The antibiotics administered in both groups are presented in Supplementary Table 1.


The results are shown in Fig. 2. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with survival. All variables used in the analysis had a VIF of <2, excluding the possibility of multicollinearity. A precise calibration was performed using the validation cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic: 0.83; Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test: P = 0.83; Supplementary Figures 1 and 2). No difference was found between the IVIG-treated group and control group in terms of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-1.04, P = 0.92), 30-day mortality (adjusted OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.93-1.05, P = 0.88), and 7-day mortality (adjusted OR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.92-1.06, P = 0.88).

Sensitivity analysis was performed using the propensity score matching method; Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of the 158 pairs of matched patients. The in-hospital mortality rate was 31.0% (49/158) in both groups (adjusted OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.62-1.61, P >0.99). Similarly, the 30-day mortality rates were 29.1% (46/158) in the IVIG-treated group and 28.5% (45/158) in the control group (adjusted OR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.67-1.79, P = 0.71); the 7-day mortality rates were 8.2% (13/158) in the IVIG-treated group and 6.3% (10/158) in the control group (adjusted OR: 1.33, 95% CI: 0.56-3.12, P = 0.52).

Results of the subgroup analysis of patients who received clindamycin and those diagnosed with STSS are shown in Fig. 3. There was no difference between the IVIG-treated and control patients in either of the subgroups. In patients who received clindamycin, the adjusted OR of in-hospital mortality was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.53-1.45, P = 0.70), whereas the adjusted OR of 30-day mortality was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.59-1.52, P = 0.88). Among patients diagnosed with STSS, the adjusted OR of in-hospital mortality was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.31-2.01, P = 0.81), whereas the adjusted OR of 30-day mortality was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.30-1.97, P = 0.76). For patients who were diagnosed with STSS and received clindamycin, the adjusted OR of in-hospital mortality was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.32-2.19, P = 0.81), whereas the adjusted OR of 30-day mortality was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.35-2.21, P = 0.79).

A sensitivity analysis of the data collected from 2015-2018 was conducted, using the methods adopted in the primary analysis, to account for potential COVID-19 effects. The results presented in Supplementary Figure 3 were nearly identical to the findings of the main analysis, thereby indicating that COVID-19 had no substantial impact on the statistical outcomes. Another sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Figure 4) was performed to compare the mortality rate of 152 patients who received IVIG treatment on the day of admission (early IVIG treatment group) and those who did not (control group). No significant differences were observed in the mortality rate between the two groups (adjusted OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 0.51-2.83, P = 0.69), which was consistent with the results of the main analysis. The results of the generalized linear mixed models, which were performed to account for the inter-facility disparity of IVIG administration, are shown in Supplementary Figure 5; they were almost identical to the findings of the main analysis. Therefore, the conclusions regarding IVIG treatment remain largely unchanged even after accounting for heterogeneity across hospitals. The relationships between hospital characteristics and mortality and between hospital characteristics and the ratio of IVIG are demonstrated in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.
Discussion
This study examined the effectiveness of IVIG administration for the treatment of iGAS, which had no survival benefit. The robustness of this result was confirmed by examining the 30-day and 7-day mortality rates and performing propensity score matching. No survival benefit was observed in patients diagnosed with STSS or in those receiving clindamycin. These results consistently showed that IVIG administration had no survival benefit, even when the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, early administration, and inter-facility disparities were considered.
The reason for administering IVIG treatment in patients with iGAS is based on several mechanisms. IVIG suppresses excessive immune responses by neutralizing streptococcal superantigens [13] or inhibiting T-cell proliferation and cytokine production [14,15]. A few studies have been conducted to assess its clinical usefulness. The systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Parks et al. [16] investigated the prognosis of patients with STSS who were treated with IVIG. The administration of IVIG reduced the mortality rate from 33.7% to 15.7%, thereby suggesting that IVIG treatment is the preferred option. Although this conclusion appears to conflict with our findings, the OR for 30-day mortality due to IVIG treatment, calculated from the data presented in the aforementioned meta-analysis, was 0.37 (0.17-0.79). By contrast, our study determined an adjusted OR of 0.86 (0.35-2.21) for 30-day mortality in patients with STSS who underwent clindamycin treatment. These values are not fundamentally different, but they suggest that the true treatment effect of IVIG can be observed between these values. Hence, our results do not replace the previous findings that demonstrated the effectiveness of IVIG in patients with STSS.
A previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluated the efficacy of IVIG in patients with STSS and reported a mortality rate of 36% in the control group, which was similar to the result of our study; contrary to our results, the above RCT reported a 3.6-fold lower mortality in the IVIG treatment group (12.5% (1/8) and 30% (3/10) in the IVIG and placebo groups, respectively, P = 0.3) [9]. This RCT was terminated early due to sluggish patient recruitment. As the RCT was underpowered, it is unclear whether this difference in survival between the IVIG-treated and control groups was attributed to the effect of IVIG or was due to a random variability.
As previous studies have used historical cohorts as the control group or used questionnaire-based information, lead-time bias or selection bias may have caused the background differences between the groups. In the present study, slight differences in background characteristics were observed between the IVIG-treated and control groups, even before the adjustment [6,7]. The larger sample size and minor background differences between the cohorts enabled the creation of an accurate model and facilitated the propensity score matching between the cohorts.
The Immunoglobulin for Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections: A Randomised Controlled Trial is an RCT that evaluated the treatment effect of IVIG in patients who were diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. Although the main analysis of this study showed no survival benefit from IVIG, it showed a benefit in patients with infection in the extremities treated with IVIG [17]. As necrotizing fasciitis in the extremities is usually caused by GAS, IVIG may be effective in patients with GAS necrotizing fasciitis. The outcome in this study was the physical component summary score; therefore, IVIG may be beneficial in other aspects such as physical health, in the absence of a difference in the mortality rate. The study conducted by Kadri et al. [18] is similar to the present study; both studies employed propensity score matching to evaluate the efficacy of IVIG treatment. Nevertheless, the study assessed the impact of IVIG in necrotizing fasciitis, with patients infected with GAS accounting for only 6.8% of the total study population. Consequently, the population under investigation differs from that of the present study.
In this study, the clinician's decision of whether to administer IVIG was treated as a random effect, considering the patients’ severity. The internal validity of the prediction model was confirmed using a validation cohort. The proportion of patients treated with IVIG in this study was relatively low (38.9% in the STSS coded subgroup). This overall low percentage of IVIG treatment might be attributable to the Japanese guidelines and insurance regulations: the administration of IVIG to patients is recommended by the Japanese guidelines, but with a very low certainty of evidence (grade 2D). Moreover, insurance coverage only allows for doses up to 5 g/day for severe infections. While the presence of unknown confounding factors cannot be entirely ruled out, our assumption appears reasonable given these circumstances. Moreover, there were a substantial number of patients who had not been treated with clindamycin. Some patients were administered linezolid instead of clindamycin, reflecting the increasing recommendation of linezolid as an adjunctive therapy in consideration of clindamycin resistance [19]. Given that clindamycin administration could be indicative of a patient's severity, we performed severity adjustments using logistic regression and propensity score matching. Furthermore, the robustness of our results was confirmed by conducting a stratified analysis exclusively among patients treated with clindamycin.
This study has some limitations. First, compared with those of planned prospective investigations, the diagnoses documented in the database were not validated. However, a previous study showed that the specificity of the DPC database diagnoses exceeded 96% [20]. Second, patients discharged within 2 days after admission were excluded. Although this population is unlikely to completely benefit from IVIG treatment, the consequences of this bias are unknown. Third, the presence of residual confounding factors remains a possibility even if the predictive model is well validated. In particular, laboratory findings, results of Gram staining, and respiratory status are likely to be covariates of the model; however, these variables were not included in this study. Fourth, the efficacy of IVIG in sepsis triggered by iGAS was investigated, and a subgroup analysis was conducted specifically on patients with a diagnosis code for STSS. However, there is a possibility that there were patients with STSS who were not coded as such, making it challenging to compare the existing pathology between these groups. Fifth, the present study investigated the treatment effect of IVIG on the mortality risk of patients with iGAS and found no observable improvement in survival outcomes. However, other factors such as length of hospital stay and quality of life, which may impact the outcomes beyond survival, were not examined in this study. Nevertheless, this study provides a higher level of evidence than that provided in previous studies, which reported the lack of effectiveness of IVIG in patients with iGAS, as it was conducted in a large population and the analysis minimized the effect of confounding factors.
Conclusion
This study found no survival benefit from IVIG administration. This result broadly applies to iGAS; however, the overall findings should not be extrapolated to STSS as the effect of IVIG administration in this condition remains uncertain. Considering the rarity of iGAS, conducting an RCT may be impractical. Therefore, an equivalent or more extensive observational study is warranted to validate these findings.
