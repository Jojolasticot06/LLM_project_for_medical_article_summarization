Cumulative oxytocin dose in spontaneous labour – Adverse postpartum outcomes, childbirth experience, and breastfeeding

Introduction
National guidelines exist for indications of oxytocin infusion and correct infusion regimens to reduce potential side effects but does not propose a safe maximum cumulative oxytocin dose during labour [1, 2]. Oxytocin infusion during labour has been associated with long labours [3], emergency caesarean sections (CS), post-partum haemorrhages (PPH), obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASI), low umbilical-cord arterial pH and increased risk for admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit [4, 5]. Furthermore, oxytocin augmentation has been related to a negative birth experience [5] and with lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding or involuntary early cessation of breastfeeding [6, 7, 8]. Synthetic oxytocin is also a water-retaining drug with a subsequent poly-ureal phase after the cessation of the infusion [9].
Earlier studies have explored cumulative oxytocin dose in relation to maternal Body Mass Index (BMI) [10, 11] and different regimes of oxytocin infusion in relation to mode of birth and related obstetric outcomes [12]. Retrospectively calculated oxytocin dose has been related to labour and birth outcomes for women with induced labours [11], but not to postpartum outcomes, breastfeeding or birth experience in women with spontaneous onset of labour.
Therefore, we aimed to determine the association between the total cumulative oxytocin dose during labour and adverse postpartum outcomes, childbirth experience and breastfeeding in term primiparous women with spontaneous onset of labour.
Materials and methods
Study setting and participants
This prospective observational multicentre study, included primiparous women with spontaneous onset of labour and oxytocin infusion during labour and was conducted between April 2017 and February 2019 at all seven obstetrical units in the southeast health-region of Sweden. Further inclusion criteria were a single foetus in a cephalic presentation, term pregnancy (≥37 gestational weeks), a need for oxytocin infusion during labour and a registered cumulative oxytocin dose in the medical records.
The cumulative oxytocin dose was prospectively measured. All seven hospitals in the southeast health region are public hospitals: six regional and one university hospital.
Ethics
Ethical approval was obtained from the Regional Ethical Board in Linköping, Sweden (Dnr 2017/277–31, date of approval June 14, 2017, amendment Dnr 2019–01059, date of approval February 19, 2019).
Guidelines and recommendations
All obstetrical units adhered to the same protocols regulating oxytocin augmentation [2] and the same diagnosis criteria for labour arrest [13]. Oxytocin infusion was administered intravenously, via an electrical infusion pump. Synthetic oxytocin (1 ml, 5 IU/mL) was diluted into 500 ml 0.9 % sodium chloride solution, end concentration of 10 mU/ml. The oxytocin administration was initiated at 3.3 mU/min and increased with 3.3 mU/min every 20 min until progress in cervical dilatation and/or until 4–5 contractions/10 min occurred.
Data collection and definition of variables
Maternal, obstetric, and neonatal data was prospectively recorded in electronic medical records (Obstetrix®, Cerner) by nurse-midwives and physicians. The nurse-midwife recorded the cumulative oxytocin dose, registered by the electronic infusion pump from start of oxytocin infusion to birth, in the electronic medical record.
The following maternal and obstetric characteristics were assessed; age, early pregnancy BMI, asthma, or lung disease, smoking in early pregnancy, epilepsy, SLE, chronic renal disease, chronic hypertension, pre-pregnancy diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, time in active labour (time from start of regular, painful contractions to birth), cervical dilatation at start of oxytocin infusion and mode of birth. Neonatal characteristics that were assessed were gestational age and weight.
The postpartum outcome variables that were extracted were OASI, PPH (nationally defined as > 1000 ml blood loss), Apgar score at five minutes, and umbilical cord arterial pH (routinely assessed in all births). Bladder overdistension (defined as the occurrence of > 1000 ml urine in the bladder postpartum, requiring an indwelling catheter for bladder rest) was evaluated in vaginal births only. Furthermore, data on breastfeeding without supplements/formula at one week and three months postpartum was collected. The perceived birth experience was routinely measured during the stay at the postpartum ward using the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) 1–10. A negative birth experience was defined as a VAS score 1–4 [14].
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using SPSS Statistical Package version 25.0 (IBM Corporation, 1989). Categorical data is presented as number and percent (n %), continuous data as mean and one standard deviation (SD) or median and inter quartile range (IQR) if not normally distributed.
Maternal and neonatal outcomes were analysed using Chi2 and logistic regression models. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR/aOR) were calculated to assess the association between cumulative oxytocin dose and binary outcomes, using the 25–75 percentile of cumulated received oxytocin dose as reference group. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) was used to assess for true confounders (supplementary 1). Using the results from the DAG, maternal age, early pregnancy BMI, epidural anaesthesia, and macrosomia (neonatal weight > 4000 g), were adjusted for in a stepwise regression model. The 95th percentile (number and range of received cumulative oxytocin dose) was also calculated (supplementary 2).
A dropout analysis was performed comparing women with and without a registered cumulative oxytocin dose in the medical records (supplementary 3).
Results
The study population included 1395 women. A flowchart of the study population is presented in Fig. 1.

The cumulative oxytocin dose ranged between 20 mU–58240 mU (median 1930 mU). Within the oxytocin groups, the cumulative oxytocin dose ranged between 20 and 750 mU (n = 341) in the < 25th percentile group, 760–4370 mU (n = 701) in the 25 th-75th percentile group and 4380–58240 mU (n = 351) in the > 75th percentile. In the 95th percentile (n = 62), the cumulative oxytocin dose ranged from 9974 to 58240 mU (supplementary 2).
Descriptive characteristics of the study population are presented in Table 1. No women reported having epilepsy, SLE, chronic renal disease, chronic hypertension, or diabetes mellitus type I or II.

Table 2 shows absolute numbers and percentage for adverse postpartum outcomes, birth experience and exclusive breastfeeding according to cumulative the oxytocin dose. Table 3 shows the results from the logistic regression presented as crude and adjusted ORs for maternal and neonatal outcomes.

The crude analysis showed that women with a cumulative oxytocin dose > 75th percentile had an increased risk of PPH (>1000 ml), Apgar score < 7 at 5 min, bladder overdistention, negative birth experience and decreased chance of exclusive breastfeeding one week postpartum while women with a cumulative oxytocin dose < 25th percentile had a decreased risk of negative birth experience, and an increased chance of exclusive breastfeeding at one week (Table 3).
After adjusting for confounders, the risk remained increased for women with cumulative oxytocin dose > 75th percentile for PPH (>1000 ml), bladder overdistension and a negative birth experience. These women also had an increased risk of having an infant with an Apgar score < 7 at five minutes after adjusting for maternal age and early pregnancy BMI (Table 3).
Time in labour was further added as a potential confounder. This changed the ORs marginally (data not shown).
No association was found between cumulative oxytocin dose and OASI, umbilical cord arterial pH < 7.05 or exclusive breastfeeding three months postpartum (Table 3).
In the drop out analysis, no differences in background characteristics were seen, except for a higher rate of caesarean sections in women without a documented cumulative oxytocin dose in the medical record compared to the study population (10.6 % vs 5.4 %). No differences in instrumental birth rates were seen (supplementary 3).
Comments
In this study, primiparous women, at term with a single foetus in a cephalic presentation and spontaneous onset of labour who received a high cumulative oxytocin dose, had increased risks for PPH (>1000 ml), bladder overdistension, an infant with an Apgar score < 7 at five minutes, a negative birth experience and a decreased chance of exclusive breastfeeding at one week. After adjusting for confounders exclusive breastfeeding and low Apgar score no longer reach the predetermined threshold for statistical significance regarding association to cumulative oxytocin dose.
Women with high cumulative oxytocin dose during labour (e.g., >75th percentile) were three times more likely to experiencing PPH (>1000 ml) compared to women who received lower cumulative doses. This finding is in line with earlier studies which have found that exposure to (retrospectively calculate) large amounts of oxytocin infusion, or a prolonged exposure (>12 h) to oxytocin during labour increases the risk of severe PPH [15, 16, 17]. In the current study, women with the highest cumulative doses, even after excluding those with CS, had a PPH rate twice as often (11.9 %) compared to the other two groups (5.9 %/5.7 %).
There was a significantly increased risk for women with a high cumulative oxytocin dose to experience bladder overdistension. Postpartum overdistension of the bladder and postpartum urinary retention (e.g., post-void residual volume [18] has previously been associated with a prolonged second stage of labour [19], use of epidural- and/or pudendal anaesthesia, vaginal lacerations, and instrumental births [20]. As far as we know, no previous studies have investigated the correlation between bladder overdistension postpartum and the cumulative oxytocin dose during labour. In the initial post-birth hours, women typically have increased urine production due to hormonal changes. If they have received oxytocin infusion during labour, the urine volume increases further due to the additional fluid infused and heightened secretion after infusion cessation. This, in combination with epidural anaesthesia use masking the sensations of bladder filling, might contribute to the increased risk for bladder overdistension in women with high cumulative oxytocin. An over distended bladder postpartum is a preventable adverse event [21], that negatively affects the women on both a short- and long-term basis [22, 23]. Attending staff must be aware of the increased risk of bladder overdistension following a vaginal birth when large amounts of oxytocin infusion have been administered.
The current study also demonstrated an association between high cumulative oxytocin dose and negative birth experience (VAS 1–4). Birth experience is a complex outcome to study, as both adverse medical outcomes [3, 4] and factors involving labour pain, feeling of control, security, and support from partner and staff, as well as perception of respectful care influences the experience [24, 25]. In the current study, more women with a cumulative oxytocin dose > 75th percentile had a caesarean section or instrumental vaginal birth, longer labours, postpartum haemorrhages, and neonates with an Apgar-score < 7, all of which have been shown in previous research to have a negative impact on the birthing experience [3].
High cumulative oxytocin dose was also associated with giving birth to a neonate with an Apgar score < 7 at five minutes of age. This risk remained increased after adjusting for maternal background characteristics, but not after adjusting for epidural use. No earlier studies have been found that examine the association between Apgar score and cumulative oxytocin dose; however, oxytocin infusion during labour has been linked to Apgar score < 7 at five minutes and the need for neonatal intensive care [26].
In this study, the chances of exclusive breastfeeding were higher in the crude analysis for women with a low oxytocin dose (<25th percentile) while the odds were lower for women with a high oxytocin dose. This result was no longer significant after adjusting for maternal characteristics. This is contrary to findings in earlier studies demonstrating a correlation between oxytocin dose and breastfeeding outcomes [6, 7]. However these studies did not examined breastfeeding at one week postpartum. Brimdyr et al [27] and Olza et al [7] both found a negative association between the amount of oxytocin received by the woman during labour and the neonate’s suckling reflexes one hour postpartum. Olza [7] argued that the synthetic oxytocin might pass the placental barrier and depress the neonates sucking reflex immediately postpartum. The theory of placental transfer is contradicted by Buckley et al [28] as no difference in plasma oxytocin levels was found in infants whose mothers did or did not receive oxytocin administration during labour [28]. The current study supports the findings by Buckley et al [28], as exclusive breastfeeding and exposure to oxytocin infusion was only significant in the crude analysis, indicating that other factors than oxytocin dose might affect breastfeeding and neonatal behaviour.
Strengths and limitations
This study's strengths include a large number of women from all seven obstetrical units in the region, representing diverse backgrounds. The multicenter approach encompasses both rural and urban areas, ensuring results' generalizability to facilities with similar healthcare and socioeconomic conditions. Additionally, the recording of cumulative oxytocin dose was a pre-existing routine at all study sites, and the exact cumulative dose received was obtained via the electronic infusion pumps.
The current study also has limitations. As correlation, not causation, was investigated, this limits the possibility to draw such conclusions based on the data. 911 women were excluded from the analysis due to missing cumulative oxytocin dose data in medical records, and many of these had an emergency cesarean section. The emergent nature of this might have caused the missing dose recordings.
The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) has become a standard method for measuring women’s childbirth experience in Swedish hospitals over the past decade. While it provides an accessible way to assess the overall birth experience in larger cohorts, it has faced criticism, especially as a low VAS score may capture perceived safety but might miss dimensions like perceived control, own capacity, participation, and professional support [29].
Breastfeeding is a complex process influenced not only by hormonal and physical aspects, but also the mother's intention to breastfeed [30]. This study lacks information on the woman’s breastfeeding intention and whether the infant latched properly in the first few hours postpartum, crucial factors for successful breastfeeding.
Conclusion
In this study of primiparous women with a spontaneous onset of labour, we found that the women who received high cumulative oxytocin doses had increased risks for postpartum haemorrhage, bladder overdistension and a negative birth experience, after adjusting for relevant confounders. Implementing routines to prepare for, and routinely use, additional uterotonics after the expulsion of the placenta when large doses of oxytocin has been used in labour might help to prevent postpartum haemorrhages. Routines for observing bladder filling as early as one and two hours postpartum, as well as routinely using a bladder scan post micturition to assess for incomplete emptying of the bladder are easy and non-invasive procedures to reduce the risk of postpartum bladder overdistension. As women’s birth experience have a major impact on their future mental health, this as well should be routinely assessed postpartum, and support should be offered to women with negative experiences.
