Implementing digital systems to facilitate genetic testing for hereditary cancer syndromes: An observational study of 4 clinical workflows

Introduction
Genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome have been designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2014 as tier 1 genomic applications, with strong evidence supporting their implementation into clinical practice.1,2 Yet, less than 20% of individuals who are eligible have undergone genetic testing,3 representing a missed opportunity to reduce the burden of cancer among those at risk. Ongoing national efforts have prioritized the identification of effective methods for increasing case ascertainment and delivery of evidence-based health care for individuals at elevated risk for hereditary cancers.4,5
Harnessing the potential of digital solutions at a systems level for implementing population-based screening tools may be an effective approach to rapidly identifying individuals at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes who would be eligible for genetic counseling and testing.4,6 Digital systems and tools to rapidly ascertain familial risk and increase referral to genetic specialists have been developed over the years. These efforts have focused on automating the process of applying clinical practice guidelines for hereditary cancer risk, using various digital platforms including traditional websites7,  8,  9 and patient-facing chatbots.10,  11,  12 Population screening efforts to date, however, have demonstrated that even with the deployment of digital screening tools in clinical settings, the uptake of genetic counseling among those identified at risk and referred often remains low, ranging from 11% to 16%.13,  14,  15
To date, the most effective approaches for optimal implementation of hereditary cancer risk screening programs have yet to be determined. This challenge reflects complex workflows that may vary across clinical populations and health care settings. As a result, the clinical workflow used to deploy any digital system may have important downstream implications on genetic counseling and testing outcomes. For example, workflows that allow for direct ordering of genetic testing from a health care provider rather than refer to genetic counseling may yield higher genetic testing uptake rates. In one study, Nazareth et al10 deployed a chatbot at multiple clinical sites and reported a genetic testing uptake rate of 29% at sites where health care providers could directly order genetic testing. Similarly, another study that offered genetic testing without genetic counseling for individuals screened (via paper assessment) at high risk based on NCCN guidelines reported that 27% (219/813) of patients provided a sample when offered genetic testing.16 Interestingly, this study also found that the timing of service may also matter in the uptake of genetic testing, with higher rates of sample provision observed when genetic testing was offered during the clinic visit (same day, 32.8%) than during a scheduled follow-up visit with a nurse practitioner within 2 weeks (referral, 19.1%).16
Studies that have examined the effect of these digital systems have occurred primarily at a small number of sites, thus limiting the generalizability of the findings and our understanding on how their effectiveness might vary across different settings. In addition, few have examined different approaches to the implementation of these digital systems, which may also have implications for clinical outcomes and inform recommendations for best practices in this context. To address these limitations, this study focused on a large sample of 27 health care sites and their patients across US states that implemented a digital cancer genetic risk assessment program. The objective of the study was to examine the postimplementation uptake of genetic testing, overall and by 4 clinical workflows: (1) traditional referral model, (2) point-of-care scheduling (POC-S), (3) point-of-care counseling/telegenetics (POC-C), and (4) point-of-care testing (POC-T).
Materials and Methods
Digital cancer genetic risk assessment program
CancerIQ (www.canceriq.com) is a digital health care technology platform that enables health care sites to launch and scale high-risk cancer programs. The fully integrated platform gathers comprehensive patient data and triages patients into different risk tiers based on the latest evidence-based guidelines (eg, NCCN, Tyrer-Cuzick). CancerIQ automatically generates pedigrees, facilitates genetic testing orders, creates personalized care plans for patients based on testing results, and monitors all follow-up care. It also supports clinicians in the management of high-risk patients over time via automated alerts to patients and providers when follow-up cancer screenings are due and educational content to increase uptake and adherence. CancerIQ is currently implemented in >200 clinic locations in a variety of clinical and patient population settings across the United States.
Study procedures
For the purposes of this study, data were made available from 27 health care sites across 10 states. Sites were selected based on the clinical workflows implemented and relatively comprehensive and complete data available for the time period from January 2019 to December 2019.
Patients at each of the sites were screened using CancerIQ either by making them complete questions on a tablet or respond to questions asked by a staff member during the visit. Follow-up care for patients screened at high risk proceeded based on 1 of 4 clinical workflows deployed at the site: (1) traditional referral—referred to genetic specialist who called to schedule an appointment, (2) POC-S—scheduled with genetic specialist immediately/leave with appointment in hand, (3) POC-C—offered immediate consult with genetic specialist via telephone (external telegenetics company), and (4) POC-T—offered immediate genetic testing after risk assessment.
Outcome variables
Study outcomes were available from the CancerIQ program on the following: (1) patients screened at high risk, (2) uptake of genetic counseling (if applicable) among high-risk patients, and (3) uptake of genetic testing among high-risk patients.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were summarized by site and by clinical workflow. For bivariate associations, we employed Pearson χ2 test to examine binary outcomes differed by types of workflows. To examine the associations between individual-level predictors and the binary outcome of genetic uptake, we conducted logistic regressions to evaluate unadjusted and adjusted associations respectively, using logit link function with binomial distribution. Owing to the observation of some small cell counts for uptake status for smaller sites and some sites lacking variable proportions of patients with genetic testing uptake, further adjustment of intraclass correlation (ICC) within sites resulted in unstable estimates or nonconvergence of the models.17 Therefore, we conducted these logistic regression models without taking ICC into account. In the fully adjusted model, we used fixed effects approach (eg, indicator approach) to assess the associations of clinical workflows and genetic testing uptake while controlling for age, sex, cancer history, type of site, and density. We used two-sided type 1 error rate of 0.05 or less for statistical significance. All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Clinical site characteristics
Table 1 details the characteristics of the 27 clinical sites. Sites varied by type of practice and specialty and included 15 breast or colon health centers (imaging sites) (56%), 3 primary care sites (3%), and 7 other clinical specialty sites (obstetrics and gynecology, gastroenterology, oncology; 26%). Two sites (7%) were considered combined sites where screening via CancerIQ was offered across clinical settings. Clinic workflows deployed at various sites were not independent of the type of practice. In particular, breast and colon health centers were less likely to deploy a POC-T workflow (2/15, 13%) compared with primary care and other specialty or combined sites (7/12, 58%; χ2 = 6.075, P value based on Fisher exact test = .037).

Case ascertainment, genetic testing, and genetic counseling
In 2019, a total of 102,542 patients were screened and 33,113 (32%) were identified as at high risk and meeting NCCN genetic testing criteria for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, or both. Among the 33,113 patients identified at high risk, 5147 (16%) proceeded with genetic testing. Genetic testing rates ranged widely across sites (2%-53%, Table 2) and significantly varied by clinical workflow (6% referral, 10% POC-S, 14% POC-C, and 35% POC-T; χ2 = 2837.4, P < .0001; Figure 1).

Across the 18 sites deploying clinical workflows that included genetic counseling before testing, uptake of genetic counseling was 11% (range = 3%-50%). Counseling rates varied significantly by clinical workflow (8% referral, 11% POC-S, 15% POC-C; χ2 = 219.9, P < .001; Figure 2), although considerable variability in counseling uptake was observed across sites within workflows (Table 2). Notably, 88% of patients proceeded with genetic testing after counseling.

Predictors of genetic testing uptake
Table 3 details the bivariate and multivariate results from the logical regression models. In the unadjusted bivariate models, age, sex, clinical workflows, type of site, and density (ie, suburban) were significantly associated with genetic testing uptake. In the fully adjusted multivariate logistic model, the odds of testing were significantly greater in POC-S (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.074, 95% CI = 1.843-2.335), POC-C (aOR = 2.735, 95% CI = 2.408-3.108), and POC-T (aOR = 6.197, 95% CI = 5.482-7.005) workflows than that in the referral-based workflow. Older age was associated with a decreased odds of testing (aOR = 0.981, 95% CI = 0.979-0.983) and personal cancer history was associated with an increased odds of testing (aOR = 1.291, 95% CI = 1.193-1.397). In addition, the odds of testing were significantly greater for nonimaging clinical sites (aOR = 1.349, 95% CI = 1.241-1.467) and sites in suburban locations (aOR = 1.402, 95% CI = 1.283-1.532).

Discussion
This study sheds light on potential best practice strategies for implementing digital hereditary cancer risk screening programs and supports the notion that the strategies for patient engagement and downstream delivery of genetic services determines the genetic testing yield in health care settings. In particular, implementing digital risk assessment tools within clinical workflows that streamline access to genetic testing shows promise as a systems-based approach to overcoming the logistical challenges (eg, scheduling, repeat visits, coordination of testing) that may contribute to the low uptake of genetic testing among those at elevated risk who are otherwise eligible.
Study findings add to the growing literature examining the effectiveness of mainstreaming models of care delivery, which removes the necessity for pretest genetic counseling delivered by genetic counselor, and is considered an alternative to traditional genetic services.18,  19,  20,  21,  22,  23 POC-T, in which genetic testing is offered to patients upon screening at risk for hereditary cancer, is akin to mainstreaming models in oncology care in that clinicians are responsible for any pretest education and discussion regarding the purpose and value of genetic testing. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine a POC-T mainstreaming approach deployed across clinical settings, which include primary care and other nononcology practices.
Genetic testing rates for sites deploying a POC-T workflow were more than double that of the other 3 workflows, averaging 35% across all the 9 POC-T sites (range 14-53%). Nonetheless, some challenges remain within the mainstreaming approach. Challenges previously reported by others include provider lack of confidence in ordering tests, interpreting results, and counseling patients.20 Patient concerns for insurance coverage and lack of interest were also noted previously as barriers to testing under this model. In addition, mandated coverage of genetic counseling as a prevention service by some insurers, which might improve the uptake of genetic counseling before testing, may also serve as an unintentional barrier to test uptake as a less streamlined workflow with fewer individuals proceeding onto genetic testing. Potential tradeoffs that exist with implementing a POC-T workflow warrant further examination for any harms (eg, lack of informed consent, less informed patients) that might arise in spite of higher rates of test uptake. Other supports for this workflow should be considered to reduce these concerns including intense training courses for nongenetic clinicians (eg, City of Hope) and alternate formats for pretest education (eg, websites, print).
Genetic testing ranged widely both within and across clinical workflow types, which highlights the variation in the effectiveness of any clinical approach implemented and the importance of understanding context that might influence downstream outcomes. Overall, the proportion (26%) of those screened and identified at high risk for hereditary cancer syndromes is consistent with other primary care–based risk stratification tools that focus on primary care patient populations unselected for disease24 and supports estimates of the population-based prevalence of individuals at high risk. Moreover, counseling uptake after assessment with digital tools (deployed with a referral workflow) was similarly low at 14.5%.7 In their study, Orlando et al7 reported that the main reason for the lack of follow-up with genetics was not that patients did not follow through but rather providers not placing referral orders (referral rate = 31%). A common reason cited by clinicians for not referring was lack of patient interest.20,25
Findings from this study support the notion that patient follow-up is not the main issue, once they are scheduled. Within the referral and POC-S workflows, at least two-thirds of patients who were scheduled for an appointment would follow through with seeing a genetic counselor. Although this study cannot distinguish between referral orders not being placed by clinicians and other reasons for the lack of scheduling (ie, patient disinterest, inability to reach patient to schedule/coordinate an appointment time), workflow estimates depicted in Figure 2 clearly indicate that >80% of individuals who were identified at risk were not scheduled for an appointment with genetics. Notably, results from the multivariate analysis found that those who were younger and had a personal cancer history were more likely to undergo genetic testing. Although all patients included in the analysis were considered at-risk, certain patients may have been more likely to have been scheduled, counseled, and ultimately tested, based on stronger clinical indications. In addition, unaffected patients may have been advised to have their affected relatives tested first, which could delay any subsequent testing based on the results. Additional work is needed to examine predictors of these different endpoints along the continuum of care to determine the extent to which they might affect who ultimately has access to and proceeds with testing.
Barriers to referral suggest a need for improvements in the referral process and education for both patients and providers on the benefits of genetic counseling.25,26 To date, however, provider education and training efforts have not yielded improvements in provider behaviors and practice, furthering the call for systems-level approaches to facilitate these efforts.27,28 Recent research indicating the presence of physician bias in referrals suggests that additional work needs to be done to ensure that referral practices do not inadvertently magnify disparities in access to genetic services.29,30
Several contextual factors appeared to play a role in genetic testing uptake, including type of clinical site and site location. The effect of type of site may be partly a reflection of the type of clinician (ie, genetic counselor, oncologist, primary care clinician, advance practice nurse) who may be discussing the results of the risk assessment and offering genetic testing to the patient.31 Notably, most nongenetic clinicians underwent training in genetic cancer risk assessment before the implementation of CancerIQ. In addition, testing was greater within clinics located in the suburban settings than in the urban settings. Future studies are needed that examine the characteristics of clinical sites32 (eg, clinical team) and geographic locations (eg, neighborhood characteristics33) that might influence testing outcomes, after the implementation of digital systems to facilitate cancer genetic service delivery.
A strength of this study is its observational nature in population-based settings across a large number of clinical sites. Patients in this study were not recruited as part of a research study to complete cancer risk assessment and screening, which may reduce some concerns about patient selection bias (ie, reflecting patients who are more likely to participate in research studies) and better represent clinical real-world findings. Nonetheless, selection bias cannot be ruled out because the total patient sampling frame at each site was not documented in the CancerIQ program, precluding our ability to generate valid estimates of the percentage of patients who completed cancer risk assessment. Anecdotal reports from some CancerIQ sites about not approaching patients over a certain age or insurance status indicates that there may also be variability with who is approached to engage in cancer risk assessment. For example, because Medicare does not cover genetic testing except for patients who have/had cancer, some sites opted not to approach patients who were on Medicare because of coverage reasons. Other research has also suggested that there may be a bias with offering risk assessment directly to the patients because those who are at higher risk were more likely to engage and use tools, likely because they suspected their risk status.8 Additional work is needed to determine engagement with a digital system for initial risk assessment on a population level.34
A few study limitations are noted. As an observational study, it is subject to the bias that comes with these types of studies. Although a randomized design would have allowed for more direct testing of workflow effects, the observational evaluation where sites have implemented workflows that fit with their resources and capabilities is more reflective of real-world implementation. Variability across the 4 workflows likely reflects in part the resource capabilities at different sites, which were not examined and outside the scope of this study. In addition, this study did not control for time elapsed since the implementation of the digital program. As such, these data should be considered a snapshot in time for 2019. It is possible that genetic counseling and testing outcomes may vary over time as sites gain experience and greater efficiency with using a digital system. Referral-based testing may take longer to complete and not have been fully captured in the observation period, thus potentially biasing results in favor of the POC-T workflow. However, most high-risk patients (89%) within this workflow were never scheduled for an appointment. As such, concerns about bias are reduced because only 11% of high-risk patients could have successfully proceeded to counseling and testing over time; a rate that remains significantly lower than the 35% testing rate observed within the POC-T workflow.
In spite of the large number of sites, some small cell counts were observed for uptake status for smaller sites and some sites lacked variable proportions of patients with genetic testing uptake. As such, our analysis did not account for the ICC within sites. The fully adjusted analysis, however, did yield important information about workflow-specific fixed effect. Study analysis did not examine race/ethnicity as a predictor of uptake because those data were missing for 45% (12/27) of the sites included in this study. Our team has conducted analyses with the 15 sites that had comprehensive race/ethnicity data to examine possible disparities in outcomes along the genetic service delivery continuum, which will be reported in a separate manuscript. Finally, data are reported for the 2019 calendar year rather than more recent years to reflect outcomes based on the various workflows before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional efforts are needed to examine how workflows that include telegenetics may have gained greater acceptability and effectiveness over time as a way to increase access to genetic services.
In summary, digital programs to support the ascertainment and management of patients at risk for hereditary cancer syndromes can be scalable and effective. Study findings highlight the effectiveness attributable to different care delivery approaches for implementing digital hereditary cancer risk screening programs. Future research is needed to understand other contextual factors influencing the variation in uptake of genetic counseling and testing, and improve the use of genetic services essential to the effective management of high-risk patients.
