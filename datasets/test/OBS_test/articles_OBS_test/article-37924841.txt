Association of patient clinical and gut microbiota features with vancomycin-resistant enterococci environmental contamination in nursing homes: a retrospective observational study

Introduction
Nursing homes increasingly provide post-acute care, such as rehabilitative therapy, to maintain and improve physical independence in residents discharged from acute-care hospitals.1 Unlike more traditional nursing home residents, those in post-acute care are more likely to receive rehabilitative therapies to improve their functional abilities, and thus have frequent interactions with the nursing home environment, such as proximate room surfaces, rehabilitation equipment, and common areas. These interactions are essential for an optimal resident experience, but also facilitate opportunities for the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), whereby MDRO-colonised residents can contaminate their environments and susceptible residents can become colonised via interaction with contaminated environments.2

Another key factor influencing the spread of MDROs in nursing homes is the high rate of antibiotic use. Antibiotic use increases susceptibility to acquiring MDRO colonisation because of perturbation of the gut microbial community and the loss of protective microbes.3 However, antibiotic use is also important in driving transmission from colonised residents, by increasing the load of colonising pathogens and thereby increasing the risk for shedding. For example, antibiotics with anti-anaerobic activity were shown to promote high-density vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) colonisation in the gut, which in turn was positively associated with resident skin and environmental contamination.4
Most infection prevention and control efforts in nursing homes have focused on disrupting MDRO transmission by environmental cleaning and hand-hygiene education in health-care workers.5,  6 However, we hypothesise that there are additional opportunities to disrupt transmission by targeting the upstream processes, namely the transfer of MDROs between patients and environments. We sought to identify resident characteristics associated with VRE-colonised residents contaminating their environment.
Methods
Study design and population
In this retrospective observational study, nursing home residents were enrolled between September, 2016, and August, 2018, as part of a previous cluster-randomised clinical trial (NCT02909946) investigating the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention to reduce the MDRO burden in six nursing homes in southeast Michigan, USA.7 Participants were enrolled within 14 days of nursing home admission. Eligibility criteria included new nursing home admission and enrolment within 14 days, and written informed consent provided by the patient or their legally authorised representative. Patients who were non-English speaking or receiving hospice care were not eligible. Demographic variables, clinical information, and microbiological surveillance specimens were collected by trained research personnel from the University of Michigan following standard protocols specified in the parent study at the time of enrolment, days 7, 14, 21, and 30, and monthly thereafter for up to 6 months, discharge, or death, as previously described.8 Written informed consent was provided by all participants or their legally authorised representative. The study protocol was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board. The protocol is available via the parent study.7
Clinical data collection
Clinical data collection was described in detail in the parent study.7 Briefly, demographic variables including age, sex, race, and length of hospital stay before nursing home admission were collected at enrolment. Comorbidities, physical independence, recent catheter use (within the past 30 days), and antibiotic exposure within the past 30 days were collected at each study visit. Physical independence was measured using the physical self-maintenance scale, a quantitative assessment for an individual's ability to perform six basic activities of daily living (toileting, feeding, dressing, grooming, ambulation, and bathing).9 A score of 6 indicates full physical independence and 30 indicates full physical dependence. Antibiotic use data and indications were extracted from hospital and nursing home medical charts, and further stratified into high-risk and low-risk on the basis of their association with risk of sepsis within 90 days of exposure.10 Participants with incomplete antibiotic use data, such as antibiotic name and time and duration of administration, were classified as not receiving antibiotics within the past 30 days. We considered third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporins, quinolones, lincosamides, penicillin combinations, monobactams, oral vancomycin, and carbapenems as high-risk antibiotics, and first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracyclines, nitroimidazoles, and sulfonamides as low-risk for microbiome disruption, on the basis of the literature around risk of sepsis following exposure.10
Microbiological data collection
At each study visit, surveillance samples were collected by trained research personnel using BactiSwab (Remel, Lenexa, KS, USA) from the participant's dominant hand and multiple body sites (oropharynx, groin, and perirectal area) and environmental surfaces in their room as described in the parent study.7 Surfaces sampled included bed control, bedside table, call button, toilet seat, doorknob, television remote, bed rail, wheelchair, walker, oxygen pump, intravenous pump, and feeding pump. Participant samples were directly plated on bile-esculin agar containing 6 μg/mL of vancomycin, and VRE was confirmed using pyrrolidonyl arylamidase testing. Perirectal VRE burden was used as a proxy of VRE gut colonisation burden, and was assessed by the semiquantitative four-quadrant plating technique, whereby growth in the first quadrant only indicated light burden and growth in the fourth quadrant indicated high burden.11 Hand and environmental samples were enriched in brain-heart infusion broth at 36°C overnight before plating and analysis. The perirectal area was additionally sampled using ESwab (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA, USA) and stored at −80°C until DNA extraction for gut microbiota analysis.
Gut microbial community analysis
DNA isolation from perirectal swabs and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region were done as described previously (appendix p 1).3 We used analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) to assess whether gut microbial samples exposed to antibiotics within the past 30 days were compositionally dissimilar.
Statistical analysis
To assess the correlation of VRE colonisation between participants and their proximate environmental surfaces, we used Cohen's κ statistics, a form of correlation coefficient calculated from observed and expected agreement, using the fmsb package (version 0.7.0).12 Only frequently sampled environmental surfaces and equipment (at least 400 out of 806 visits) with at least 5% prevalence (at least 40 positive VRE cultures out of 806 visits), namely participant hand, groin and perirectal area, toilet seat, bedside table, television remote, bed control, and call button, were considered for correlation analysis.
Clinical features between uncolonised and colonised residents at enrolment were discerned using Student's t test (continuous variables) or Fisher's exact test (categorical variables). To assess whether perirectal VRE burden was different between visits in which VRE was detected in participant oropharynx, groin, or perirectal samples but not in environmental samples and visits in which VRE was detected in both environmental and participant samples, semiquantitative quadrant streak results were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. We identified clinical factors associated with concurrent participant colonisation and environmental contamination using a multivariable generalised estimating equation model (appendix p 1).
All statistical analyses were done using R (version 3.6.1).
Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.
Results
We enrolled 245 participants from six nursing homes as part of a previous intervention study,7 with 238 (97%) participants directly admitted from an acute-care hospital. Participants had a mean age of 72·5 years (SD 13·6), 111 (45%) were men, 134 (55%) were women, 132 (54%) were non-Hispanic white, and 112 (46%) were African American (table 1). We conducted 806 visits (mean 3·3 [SD 2·0] visits for each participant), collected 2802 participant samples (hand, oropharynx, perirectal, and groin), and 5592 environmental samples (mostly bedside table, bed control, call button, doorknob, toilet seat, television remote, wheelchair, and bed rail).7 Not all types of samples listed here were obtained from all enrolled participants at every visit (appendix p 2). At baseline, VRE colonisation was present in 49 (20%) participants, with environmental surfaces being contaminated in 36 (73%) of these patients.

On the basis of previous work from our group, 13,  14,  15 we first examined the potential role of hand contamination as an intermediary between participant colonisation and environmental contamination. VRE prevalence across all hand samples (n=789) was significantly higher when VRE was found on both participant and environmental sites (hand contaminated in 50 [51%] of 99 hand samples) than when VRE was present only on participant body sites (hand contaminated in seven [13%] of 55 hand samples; p<0·0001; figure 1A). Because VRE was frequently found on hands, participant body sites, and various environmental surfaces, we used Cohen's κ to assess the concordance between participant VRE colonisation and VRE detected on environmental surfaces. Hand colonisation was positively associated with VRE presence in the groin and perirectal area (Cohen's κ 0·43) and environmental surfaces closest to participants: call button, tabletop, bed control, and television remote (Cohen's κ 0·45–0·48; figure 1B), supporting the role of residents' hands in transferring VRE from their body to their room environment.

Next, we sought to assess whether participant characteristics were associated with VRE contamination of their environment. Each visit was assigned to one of four groups on the basis of VRE culture results: uncolonised (ie, no VRE detected in participant or environmental samples), environment only (ie, VRE detected in environmental samples but not in participant samples), participant only (ie, VRE detected in participant oropharynx, groin, or perirectal samples but not in environmental samples), or participant and environment (ie, VRE detected in both environmental and participant samples; appendix p 3).
At baseline, we found no significant differences in clinical features between uncolonised participants and participants in the environment-only group (table 1). Using univariate analyses, the participant-only group had a significantly higher proportion of urinary catheter use in the past 30 days and higher physical dependence compared with the uncolonised group, whereas those in the participant and environment group were more likely to have longer hospital stays before nursing home admission and exposure to antibiotics deemed to be high-risk for microbiota disruption compared with the uncolonised group (table 1). Additionally, the participant and environment group was younger and had a similar mean level of physical independence to that in the uncolonised group (table 1).
The association between high-risk antibiotics and participants having VRE detected in both participant and environmental cultures suggested a role of microbiota disruption in environmental contamination. To test this hypothesis, we assessed whether participants exposed to high-risk antibiotics had gut microbial communities compositionally distinct from those of participants with either no antibiotic exposure or exposure to antibiotics with a low risk of gut microbiome disruption.10 We collected 316 perirectal ESwab samples for gut microbial community analysis from 137 participants (mean 2·3 [SD 1·6] samples each; appendix p 2). We analysed microbial community samples by 16S rRNA sequencing to identify operational taxonomic units and their relative abundances. Clustering of 16S data using ANOSIM revealed that although exposure to high-risk antibiotics caused the composition to differ from that of samples without recent exposure to any antibiotics (p=0·011), exposure to low-risk antibiotics caused a similar level of perturbation (p=0·0004), and we found no statistically significant difference in the composition between gut microbial communities exposed to low-risk or high-risk antibiotics (p=0·59; figure 2A).

To further investigate the role of microbiota-disruptive antibiotics in environmental shedding, we tested whether the groups differed in their gut microbiota, independent of antibiotic history. Although participants in the participant-only (p=0·071) and participant and environment groups (p=0·025) had compositionally distinct gut microbial communities from that of the uncolonised group, the groups were not statistically significantly different from each other (p=0·29). Additionally, participants in the participant and environment group did not have a higher VRE burden than those in the participant-only group (p=0·93; appendix p 4). Thus, although microbiota disruption was associated with VRE colonisation, we did not find support for either altered microbiota composition or increased VRE load in mediating environmental contamination among VRE-colonised participants.
Finally, we sought to identify an independent set of factors associated with VRE-colonised participants contaminating their environment. We built a multivariate model comparing participant-only and participant and environment groups that considered participant clinical factors, including age, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, length of previous hospital stay, recent use of urinary catheter, recent exposure to antibiotics, physical self-maintenance scale score, sex, and facility intervention. After a forward–backward selection process to refine model fit, the most informative predictors discriminating the two groups were recent antibiotic exposure, recent urinary catheter use, male sex, and physical self-maintenance scale score. Notably, in a preliminary model including all four predictors, both urinary catheter use and increasing physical self-maintenance scale score (higher functional dependence) were negatively associated with the participant (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·42 [95% CI 0·17–1·05]) and environment outcome (0·93 [0·84–1·02]). Further investigation using data from the participant-only and participant and environment groups indicate that urinary catheter use was associated with higher physical dependence; the mean physical self-maintenance scale score was 14·5 (4·3) for participant visits with no urinary catheter use, in contrast with 18·6 (4·5) for those with urinary catheter use (p<0·0001).
To investigate whether participant interaction with their environment was associated with the risk of concurrent participant colonisation and environmental contamination, we used recent antibiotic exposure, male sex, and physical self-maintenance scale in the final model. All variables remained statistically significant in the final multivariable model, and the participant and environment outcome was positively associated with recent antibiotic exposure (aOR 2·75 [95% CI 1·22–6·16]) and male sex (2·75 [1·24–6·08]), and negatively associated with higher physical dependence (0·91 [0·83–0·99]; table 2). To better understand the reasons underlying increased antibiotic use in the participant and environment group, we examined antibiotic indication at baseline. Compared with other groups, participants in the participant and environment group were more likely to have exposure to either high-risk or low-risk antibiotics, and the most common reason for antibiotic use was urinary tract infection (appendix p 5).

Discussion
Post-acute care facilities such as nursing homes are increasingly important in modern health-care services.8 Although understudied, studies have shown an alarmingly high prevalence of MDRO colonisation among nursing home residents, indicating an urgent need to identify points of intervention to reduce MDRO transmission in this setting.16 Here, we sought to improve our understanding of MDRO transmission in nursing homes by identifying participant factors associated with the spread of VRE from residents to their room environment. Using a combination of participant and environmental surveillance, gut microbial community analyses, and clinical data, we found that exposure to microbiota-disruptive antibiotics in the past 30 days, increased physical independence, and participant-hand contamination were associated with VRE environmental contamination among VRE-colonised participants. These results highlight the potential for antibiotic stewardship and resident hand hygiene as intervention targets to reduce transmission by reducing resident contamination of their environments.
Contrary to our intuition, high physical dependence and a presumed reduction in self-care was not associated with environmental contamination. Rather, we found that environmental contamination among VRE-colonised participants was associated with increased physical independence. This observation, along with the high concordance in VRE contamination between participant hands and close-proximity, high-touch surfaces, further implicates the role of resident activity in VRE transmission within nursing homes.17,  18 This result highlights unique challenges associated with the prevention of MDRO transmission in nursing homes. Although nursing homes traditionally provided long-term care for older adults with functional and cognitive disabilities, in the past decade the number of younger patients (<75 years) receiving short-term care (<100 days) has increased, often with an emphasis on rehabilitation therapies to restore and maintain physical ability.8 The frequent interactions between residents and the physical environment could contribute to the increased spread of MDROs in rehabilitation-based nursing homes, compared with in acute-care settings. Our results are consistent with the direct role of nursing home residents in environmental contamination and highlight the need for the development of tailored interventions that consider unique characteristics of nursing home populations (figure 3).

Our results also highlight the role of antibiotic use in both the acquisition of VRE and subsequent contamination of the room environment. Antibiotic overuse in older adults remains a challenging problem, including, but not limited to, asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can be misdiagnosed as a suspected urinary tract infection, and accounts for 30–56% of antibiotics prescribed.19 Better defined clinical criteria for urinary tract infection will lead to less misdiagnosis and reduce antibiotic use.20 In addition to the expected role of antibiotics, we also identified male sex as a significant risk factor for concurrent colonisation and contamination, consistent with a previous study examining the role of sex on MDRO colonisation in a similar nursing home population.21 These results suggest that biological and behavioural differences among sexes, such as immune response and microbiome profiles that might alter colonisation risk, and hand use and hygiene patterns warrant further study to better understand the epidemiology of VRE between sexes.
This study has some limitations. First, we only obtained perirectal samples from a few study visits, reducing the power of our analyses and our ability to examine the temporal dynamics of the gut microbiota within participants. To retain a reasonable sample size, we used all perirectal samples in our analysis, with 81 participants having more than one sample taken (appendix p 2). To account for within-participant clustering of variables over time, participant identifications were specified as clusters in our model. Second, as nearly all the enrolled participants in the parent study were admitted with an anticipated short stay,7 only 99 (40%) participants were followed up for up to four visits (day 21) before being discharged or leaving the study for various reasons, reducing the effective sample size. However, the average number of follow-up visits was similar across different colonisation groups; thus, attrition bias was unlikely to be introduced. Third, history of VRE colonisation of the participant and the VRE colonisation status of the previous participant occupying the same room as enrolled participants were not included in our analysis because of a paucity of available data. Additionally, because participants were recruited by our study team after residents had been assigned to their rooms, we were not able to assess environmental contamination before enrolment. Fourth, the imbalance in sample size in various groups might affect the reliability of statistical test, and we did not do a power calculation for this analysis. Fifth, because VRE semi-quantification data were only available for a subset of perirectal samples, we did not do a correlation analysis between colonisation intensities with participant characteristics. Lastly, we did not do genomic sequencing to test the relationship between participant VRE isolates and environmental isolates, but rather assumed strain concordance when detected. However, this assumption is likely to be valid for VRE because previous studies examining environmental contamination in a similar population found highly similar VRE strains on participant hand, perirectal region, groin, and high-touch environmental surfaces.22,  23
Overall, our results support a model of VRE transmission in nursing homes whereby colonised residents with sufficient physical independence can contaminate their environment via their hands, which is likely to increase the chance of a resident with an antibiotic-disrupted microbiota acquiring VRE colonisation, either directly from the contaminated environment or via a health-care worker intermediate (figure 3). In addition to more judicious use of antibiotics, this model highlights resident hand hygiene as a potential high-value target to reduce VRE transmission in nursing homes. In the past decade, hand-hygiene education has become an important component of infection prevention in the hospital setting.24,  25 By contrast, hand hygiene has been overlooked in the nursing home setting.13 Furthermore, by reducing environmental contamination, hand-hygiene interventions for nursing home residents are likely to increase the effect of improvements in health-care worker hand hygiene and environmental cleaning.
