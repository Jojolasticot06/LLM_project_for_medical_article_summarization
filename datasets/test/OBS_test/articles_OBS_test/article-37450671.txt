Prevalence of Immunomodulator Use as Combination Therapy With Vedolizumab or Ustekinumab in Inflammatory Bowel Disease

INTRODUCTION
The introduction of biologic therapies, including antitumor necrosis factor therapies (anti-TNFs), revolutionized the treatment of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Anti-TNFs, namely infliximab, have been shown in large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to be associated with greater rates of clinical remission when used as so-called “combination therapy” with immunomodulators, including methotrexate, azathioprine, or 6-mercaptopurine (1,2). Use of combination therapy has been associated with lower rates of antidrug antibody (ADA) development and increased anti-TNF drug levels, a commonly proposed mechanism for the increased efficacy observed with this practice (3).

Novel biologics, including vedolizumab, an anti-integrin, and ustekinumab, an interleukin 12/23 inhibitor, represent unique treatment mechanisms from anti-TNFs. Similar to anti-TNFs, higher levels of vedolizumab and ustekinumab are associated with increased rates of clinical remission; however, rates of ADA development seem to be lower for vedolizumab and ustekinumab, and ADAs do not always seem to be closely correlated with clinical outcomes (4–10).

The risks and benefits of adding an immunomodulator to vedolizumab or ustekinumab remain unclear. A growing body of data including a recent meta-analysis of 16 studies and 1 prospective study did not show clinical benefit with this practice (11–13). Conversely, a recent, large 2-nation population-based study did show benefit of thiopurines in combination with vedolizumab, although statistically significant only in patients with CD treated with vedolizumab (14). In contrast to anti-TNFs, vedolizumab and ustekinumab carry a uniquely low or no increased risk of serious and opportunistic infections (15,16). Immunomodulators have been shown to be associated with numerous potential complications, including lymphoma, nonmelanoma skin cancers, and serious infections, with serious infections being of particular concern in those aged 65 years or older (17–19). The favorable safety profile of vedolizumab and ustekinumab could therefore be compromised by the addition of an immunomodulator.

While more large-scale prospective data are needed, the known risk of adding an immunomodulator with ustekinumab or vedolizumab without clear benefit warrants further investigation of current prescribing practices. In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of immunomodulator use as combination therapy with vedolizumab or ustekinumab in a real-world cohort of patients with IBD. In assessing these real-world practice patterns, we hypothesized that combination therapy would be used commonly, especially in those with prior exposure to anti-TNFs, younger age, and certain disease characteristics associated with more difficult-to-treat disease, including perianal involvement. In addition, we hypothesized that the use of combination therapy with these novel biologics would decrease with time from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as more data emerged regarding rates of ADA formation and immunogenicity.

METHODS
Data source
TARGET-IBD is a prospective longitudinal observational cohort of consented patients with IBD receiving usual care at 34 centers (13 community, 21 academic) across the United States. The structure of TARGET-IBD has been described elsewhere and is similar to that of other TARGET observational cohorts (TARGET-NASH, TARGET-HCC, TARGET-DERM, TARGET-PBC, TARGET-HBV), which aim to describe real-world diagnosis, management, and disease course (20–23). Adults (aged 18 years or older) and children with a diagnosis of CD, UC, or indeterminate colitis as determined by a treating physician and who are receiving any prescription therapy for IBD are eligible for inclusion in TARGET-IBD. Patients unable to provide written informed consent/assent, enrolled in any interventional study for IBD therapy, those with a history of prior total abdominal colectomy for UC, or those not meeting the inclusion criteria are excluded. Central institutional review board approvals are obtained prior to enrollment. Patients provide informed consent for up to 3 years of retrospective redacted medical information and up to 5 years of prospective data. Redacted medical records from participating sites are uploaded every 6 months into a secured data repository. There are no predetermined interventions or assessments.

For the purposes of this study, clinical information for adults enrolled in TARGET-IBD between July 2017 and November 2020 was ascertained from electronic medical records by trained abstractors and stored in a secured repository. Extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) were identified using a text search that included joint EIMs (ankylosing spondylitis, enteropathic arthritis, arthropathy, joint ankylosis, peripheral arthritis, sacroiliitis, and spondyloarthropathy), ocular EIMs (anterior uveitis, episcleritis, iritis, scleritis, and uveitis), and cutaneous EIMs (erythema nodosum, pyoderma, and pyoderma gangrenosum).

Patients were included in the combination therapy group if they were on vedolizumab or ustekinumab with an immunomodulator (methotrexate, azathioprine, or 6-mercaptopurine) at any point in the retrospective or prospective period, with the exception of the analysis of prescription practices by year, where patients were considered to be on combination therapy only if an immunomodulator was used with vedolizumab or ustekinumab within the specified period.

Outcomes
The primary outcome of this study was the prevalence of combination therapy with ustekinumab and vedolizumab in our real-world IBD cohort. We compared this with the prevalence of combination therapy with anti-TNFs in the same cohort.

Secondary outcomes included predictors of combination therapy with vedolizumab and ustekinumab, stratified by disease type (UC and CD). Examined predictors included type of practice (academic vs community), patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), tobacco use, disease duration, previous biologic exposure(s), and previous steroid use, and for CD, history of IBD surgery, disease location, and history of perianal disease. Additional secondary outcomes included changes in practices over time (within 2 years of the US FDA drug approval and after 2 years of the US FDA drug approval) and relationship of EIMs to combination therapy use with vedolizumab and ustekinumab.

Statistical analysis
Rates of anti-TNF, vedolizumab, and ustekinumab monotherapy and combination therapy at any time during the study period and during enrollment were estimated. Continuous variables were summarized using the mean and SD. Categorical variables were presented as counts and proportions. Rates of combination therapy were stratified by disease type (UC vs CD) and time from drug approval. Patient characteristics were compared using the Cochran-Mantel Haenszel general association test for categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 statical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
We identified 4,039 patients with IBD, of whom 60.9% had CD. In total, 18.8% of patients were treated with vedolizumab, and 13.0% were treated with ustekinumab. Most of the patients treated with vedolizumab or ustekinumab had prior anti-TNF exposure (73.1% vedolizumab and 89.2% ustekinumab, Table 1), and many patients on ustekinumab had both anti-TNF and vedolizumab exposure (27.5%). The proportion of patients on combination therapy with vedolizumab and ustekinumab exceeded 30% (30.7% combination therapy with vedolizumab, 36.2% combination therapy with ustekinumab), whereas 41.1% of patients treated with anti-TNFs were on combination therapy.

Predictors of combination therapy
When examining predictors of combination therapy with vedolizumab or ustekinumab, we found that patients who had any previous biologic exposure were significantly more likely to use combination therapy (P < 0.001 for vedolizumab in CD, P = 0.045 for vedolizumab in UC, P < 0.001 for ustekinumab in CD, Table 2). Furthermore, additional biologic exposures were associated with an increased likelihood of combination therapy (P < 0.001). Combination therapy was also more likely in patients with perianal disease (P = 0.02 for vedolizumab, P = 0.03 for ustekinumab). Older patients were significantly less likely to be on combination therapy with ustekinumab in CD (P = 0.01); however, this relationship was not seen for patients with UC or CD on vedolizumab. No significant difference in combination therapy use was seen for sex, race, BMI, tobacco use, duration of disease, or steroid use with either vedolizumab or ustekinumab. In addition, in patients with CD, a history of IBD surgery and location of CD were not associated with the use of combination therapy. Last, the presence of EIMs was only associated with increased rates of combination therapy for those patients with cutaneous EIMs on ustekinumab (Table 3). Patients with UC treated with ustekinumab were excluded from these analyses because of small numbers (n = 17) in the setting of more recent approval for this indication.

Rates of combination therapy initiation
Rates of combination therapy initiation decreased over time. Rates of vedolizumab combination therapy initiation decreased from 27.6% when started in the first 2 years after the US FDA drug approval to 21.9% when started in subsequent years (25.0%–19.8% in UC, 28.7%–23.8% in CD). Rates of ustekinumab combination therapy initiation in CD decreased from 30.7% when started within 2 years of drug approval as opposed to 22.7% when started in subsequent years (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
Analysis of current prescribing practices revealed that combination therapy with vedolizumab and ustekinumab exceeded 30% in this cohort. For comparison, combination therapy with anti-TNFs, where supporting data are more robust, was used in just more than 40% of participants. The high prevalence of combination therapy with ustekinumab and vedolizumab in this population is notable, given the unclear benefit of this practice, the known low immunogenicity associated with vedolizumab and ustekinumab, and the well-described increased risk of infections, among other potential complications, associated with immunomodulators.

Other reports of real-world use of combination therapy with vedolizumab and ustekinumab are limited and only available in smaller cohorts but are in line with our findings. The rate of combination therapy use with vedolizumab in 321 patients with UC in the VedolIzumab for Health OuTComes in InflammatORY Bowel Diseases consortium was similar to that observed in our study (38% of patients had concomitant immunomodulator during that study period, 2014–2016) (24). Similar rates of combination therapy with ustekinumab in 167 patients with CD at induction have also been reported (25).

In our study, the use of combination therapy was predicted by number of prior biologics, with rates of combination therapy significantly increasing with each prior biologic exposure. This perhaps represents an attempt to decrease immunogenicity in patients who have lost response to previous therapy or therapies, although data to support this practice are lacking. In addition, more combination therapy use was seen in those patients with perianal CD, suggesting that combination therapy is used more frequently in more difficult-to-treat disease. Factors that have been associated with lower drug levels or increased immunogenicity in patients treated with anti-TNF therapy including increased BMI or current smoking status were not significant predictors of combination therapy in our analyses (26,27). Our study was likely underpowered to detect differences in certain other variables, including race. We additionally did not differentiate those cases where the immunomodulator was continued when transitioning from anti-TNF from those cases where an immunomodulator was started at the same time as vedolizumab or ustekinumab because we have no data to suggest these patients should be treated differently.

Consistent with prior studies, the group of patients on biologics included smaller numbers of older individuals (28). We only saw a difference, however, in rates of combination therapy by age group in patients with CD treated with ustekinumab. No significant difference was seen in rates of combination therapy with vedolizumab by age group. This is notable because these older patients may be especially vulnerable to infections and new/recurrent malignancies associated with the addition of an immunomodulator, and they likely merit greater caution in prescribing combination therapy.

We recognize that at times immunomodulators may be used for other indications, especially IBD-associated arthritis/arthropathies and, occasionally, for ocular or cutaneous EIMs. However, we did not find that the presence of EIMs, joint related or otherwise, was associated with an increased likelihood of combination therapy use except in those patients with CD and cutaneous EIMs on ustekinumab. Note that included cutaneous EIMs in our study did not include psoriasis, which can at times be treated with ustekinumab; thus, perhaps ustekinumab and an immunomodulator may have been used as part of treatment for other cutaneous EIMs such as pyoderma gangrenosum. In general, however, we feel this likely indicates that EIMs were not a significant consideration in initiation of combination therapy. In addition, some EIMs, especially those that correlate with disease activity, may respond to vedolizumab and ustekinumab alone despite their greater selectivity, and an immunomodulator may not have been needed (29,30).

Notably, rates of combination therapy did decrease with time, and we postulate several mechanisms for this occurrence. Previously, it has been noted that patients with refractory disease who have not responded to other available therapies make up a large proportion of the first patients treated with a new agent (31). Therefore, perhaps over time, patients with less refractory disease are being treated, and there is a decreased tendency to use combination therapy. Alternatively, perhaps because more data have become available showing low rates of ADA formation with vedolizumab and ustekinumab and concerns of immunogenicity wane, prescribing practices are changing. This change without guidance from RCTs is important to note because initial observational studies and subgroup analyses did not show benefit of combination therapy with anti-TNFs; however, high-quality RCTs did ultimately show this to be the case (1,2,32).

Strengths of our study include a large population with more than 1,200 patients treated with either vedolizumab or ustekinumab over multiple centers across the country, including both academic and community sites. Additional strengths include length of follow-up with ability to stratify combination therapy by year vedolizumab or ustekinumab was prescribed. Limitations of our study include lack of data on the usage of ustekinumab with and without combination therapy in UC due to the more recent approval of this therapy for this indication. In addition, data on comorbidities such as current or previous malignancy, which may have influenced therapy decisions, especially for those older than 65 years, were limited. While we included several markers of disease activity and severity (i.e., number of biologic exposures, prednisone use), we did not have predetermined timing of disease assessment with measures such as colonoscopy or C-reactive protein, partly because of nonstandardized practices of disease assessment and the historical nature of parts of the dataset. This limited our ability to determine therapy efficacy. Despite these limitations, our study shows a high rate of combination therapy in non-TNF biologics that has not previously been described in such a large real-world cohort. Use of combination therapy with non-TNF biologics will remain an important area of interest, especially as more novel biologics including risankizumab are introduced into practice, and IBD providers need to determine the risk and benefits of initiating or continuing an immunomodulator with these therapies as well.

In conclusion, our study shows that combination therapy is used frequently with vedolizumab and ustekinumab despite the paucity of evidence to support this practice. Combination therapy was more likely to be used in patients refractory to prior biologics and with perianal disease, but was not consistently predicted by numerous other factors including the presence of EIMs and patient age. Combination therapy practices are changing in the absence of large-scale prospective data, highlighting the need for more guidance on efficacy and safety of this practice to ensure the best care for our patients.
