Impact of antimicrobial stewardship in organisms causing nosocomial infection among COVID-19 critically ill adults

1. Introduction
Since the firsts reports of a novel viral respiratory illness emerged in December 2019 in Hubei province, China [1], the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) has infected millions worldwide and is responsible for more than six million deaths [2].
A major problem of the coronavirus pandemic is the considerable burden imposed on National Health Systems and the enormous challenge for health-care workers to deal with an unknown and transmissible illness. During the first period of the pandemic, clinical guidelines recommended empirical antibiotic use from the beginning to treat suspected bacterial co-infection in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients [3]. High prevalence rates of bacterial co-infection have been reported during previous viral pandemics such as 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic [4,5] and have been associated with higher morbidity and mortality [6,7]. Moreover, distinguishing between viral and bacterial co-infection at presentation and during the COVID-19 course can be challenging due to overlapping clinical features [8].
However, a low rate of bacterial co-infection has been reported in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, ranging from a very infrequent event (<1%) to a rate of 9,1% in different studies [9, 10, 11]. In critically ill COVID-19 patients a low rate of bacterial co-infection has also been reported, although slightly higher than in less severe patients [12,1]. Despite the evidence of a low rate of bacterial co-infection, most patients with COVID-19 received antimicrobials, mainly in critically ill patients [10,11,14,15], indicating the need for targeted COVID-19 antimicrobial stewardship initiatives to reduce the global threat of antimicrobial resistance. Evidence regarding risk factors for co-infection in COVID-19 patients is scarce. A study including hospitalized COVID-19 patients reported hypoxemia and inflammatory markers such as the levels of ferritin and levels or procalcitonin as independent risk factors for co-infection. Another study found admission from a long-term health facility and admission to intensive care unit as risk factors for co-infection in those patients [11,16].
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation of an antibiotic stewardship program in critically ill COVID-19 patients and establish risk factors for co-infection. The secondary objective is to analyze the evolution of the etiology of nosocomial respiratory infections during different waves of the pandemic.
2. Material and methods
This is a single-center retrospective observational study of consecutive patients admitted to an adult Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to COVID-19 pneumonia from March 2020 to October 2022.
We excluded patients not admitted to ICU or COVID-19 positive patients admitted to ICU due to a disease different to COVID-19 pneumonia.
We recorded patient demographics, comorbidities, severity at admission measured by APACHE II and SOFA scores and vaccination rates. Inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, leukocytes, lymphocyte and other laboratory parameters related to worse prognosis such as ferritin, troponin, pro-BNP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Lactate, Urea, Creatinine and the paO2/FiO2 relationship were also collected at admission. Clinical evolution markers were length of ICU and Hospital stay, ICU and Hospital mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation. Different pandemic waves were established based on the rate of admission during different time periods.
The administration of empirical antibiotic therapy was evaluated in all included patients as well as whether they had received monotherapy or combination therapy. The antibiotics administered were also recorded. The etiology of the first episode of clinically significant respiratory infection was collected. In this group of patients diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia is challenging due to the lack of radiologic criteria. When a patient developed fever, change in respiratory secretions, worsened respiratory failure, received antibiotic therapy and a microorganism was isolated from respiratory samples, it was included as a nosocomial respiratory infection.
An analysis of the risk factors associated with co-infection within the first 48 h of admission was performed using a multivariate regression model (refer to the statistical analysis below).
The study was approved by local ethics committee and informed consent was waived due to observational nature of the study. The study protocol is PI2016029.
2.1 Antibiotic stewardship program
During the course of the pandemic, a very low rate of co-infection was reported in various studies [9]. We analyzed the cohort of clinically ill COVID-19 patients in our ICU, and the data were consistent with those reported in different studies. Additionally, we observed a significant empirical antibiotic consumption in these patients.
We then elaborated an antibiotic stewardship document with some recommendations in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and these recommendations were presented in a clinical session. The first clinical session was on February 2021, at the end of the 2nd pandemic wave.
The document of antibiotic stewardship recommendations was based in three main key points: First it was recommended not to start empirical antibiotic therapy unless the patient was suspected to have a bacterial coinfection based in clinical judge and inflammatory parameters, mainly procalcitonin. When there was not a clinical suspicion of bacterial coinfection and procalcitonin values were low it was not recommended to start empirical antibiotic therapy.
Second, empirical antibiotic therapy could be on monotherapy due to the absence of atypical microorganisms in the etiology of coinfection in those patients [17,18] and due to the lack of demonstration of azithromycin a clinical benefit in clinical trials while it may increase the risk of side effects [19]).
And the third point was that if the antibiotic therapy was started a set of cultures including blood, respiratory and urinary samples, had to be performed before initiating antibiotics. If the result of the samples were negative, antibiotic therapy could be discontinued. These clinical sessions were regularly updated during the pandemic.
2.2 Statistical analysis
For descriptive analysis, categorical variables are presented as counts and percentages. Continuous variables as mean and standard deviation if normally distributed or as median and interquartile range (IQR) in non-normally distributed.
For group comparison, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and analysis of variance, or Kruskal-Wallis test were used for normally distributed quantitative variables, skewed distributed quantitative variables and more than two groups, respectively. Chi squared test (Fisher exact test where appropriate) for categorical variables. To test for normality Shapiro Wilk's was applied.
Univariate and multivariate mixed regression models were performed to investigate risk factors for coinfection. Variables were included in the multivariate model according the clinical relevance and significance at the univariate analysis (p<0,2).
Stata computer software version 16.0 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
3. Results
A total of 878 critically ill patients with respiratory failure due to SARS Cov-2 were admitted to the ICU during the study period. Patients were admitted in 6 pandemic periods named as pandemic waves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The distribution of patients during those pandemic periods is shown in Fig. 1.

Median age of the study population was 63 years and 70% were male. Most frequent comorbidities were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipemia and obesity. Median APACHE II and SOFA scores at admission were 12 and 3, respectively. The demographic characteristics of the study population, main clinical comorbidities, severity indexes at admission, and differences in patients admitted during the different COVID-19 waves are detailed in Table 1.

Some demographic characteristics were different between different pandemic waves. Patients in the 5th pandemic wave were younger than in remaining waves, severity at admission measured by APACHE II and SOFA scores were lower in patients admitted during 4th wave compared with other pandemic waves. Consequently, ICU and hospital stay were shorter in those patients admitted in the 4th wave (Table 1). However, there were not significant differences in ICU mortality between different pandemic waves.
ICU mortality was 17%. More than 95% of the patients surviving ICU were discharged alive from the hospital (Table 1).
The rate of bacterial co-infection at admission was 8.04% during the covid pandemics, ranging from 1.69% in the first pandemic wave to 12.14% to the 6th pandemic wave. Main isolated bacterial pathogens in coinfection were: Streptococcus pneumoniae (44.1%) followed by Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (22,1%) and Haemophilus influenzae (11,8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in the 8.8% of coinfected patients (Fig. 2).

Empirical antibiotic therapy was administered to the 96% of the patients during the first pandemic wave, mainly in combination (Table 2). As soon as the antibiotic stewardship program was implemented the rate of empirical antibiotic therapy decreased over time to the 24.7% and 30.7% of the patients in the 5th and 6th wave respectively. Combination therapy was used in the 97% of the patients during the first pandemic wave, compared to only 10% during the 6th pandemic wave (see Table 2).

Age, gender, comorbidities, severity scores, inflammatory markers and other laboratory parameters at admission were evaluated as risk factors for co-infection in this cohort. In the univariate analysis age, APACHE II, SOFA score and Pro-BNP at admission and diabetes were significantly associated with co-infection. However, after multivariate analysis SOFA was found to be the only independent risk factor for co-infection in this cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients (OR 1,23 CI 1,12 to 1,43) (Table 3, Table 4).

The 42.7% of the patients developed at least one nosocomial respiratory infection during their critical illness. The distribution of microorganisms responsible of these infections is shown in Fig. 3.

During the first wave of the pandemic Enterobacteriaceae and non- fermentative Gram Negative bacilli were the main etiological agents in nosocomial respiratory infections, accounting for 72.4% of the isolated microorganisms. However, as the pandemic evolved, a statistically significant increase of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was observed, accompanied by a decrease in the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative Gram Negative Bacilli.
4. Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate an antibiotic stewardship strategy on empirical antibiotic therapy in critically ill COVID-19 patients including all the waves of the pandemic. The most important finding in our study is that reducing unnecessary empirical antibiotic consumption is safe and it was not associated with worse clinical outcomes such as mortality or ICU length of stay.
Rates of co-infection have been reported as very low in various cohorts and meta-analyses that include critically ill COVID-19 patients. Moreover, in the most recent guidelines, empirical antibiotics are recommended when there is clinical or radiological suspicion of bacterial coinfection. However, there is no consensus on antimicrobial stewardship for critically ill COVID-19 patients [15,17,18,20]. During the initial waves of the pandemic, patients admitted to the ICU received empirical antibiotic therapy based on the recommended treatment guidelines [3]. However, a very low coinfection rate was soon observed in our patients, which was also reported in the literature [9,10]. An antibiotic stewardship program was developed to reduce the empirical antibiotic consumption. This program was based in different key points. A progressive reduction in empirical antibiotic consumption was observed during the different periods of the pandemic, with antibiotics being administered to almost all critically ill patients in the initial waves of the pandemic to one out of three in the final wave of the pandemic. Empirical antibiotic therapy was administered in combination to nine out of ten critically ill patients during the early stages of the pandemic, but it decreased to one out of ten during the last wave of the pandemic.
To optimize empirical antibiotic therapy in COVID-19 patients and prevent the absence of empirical antibiotic therapy in co-infected patients, we analyzed the risk factors for co-infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Most studies assessing risk factors for co-infection have focused on patients admitted to the hospital [21,22]. In fact, admission to the intensive care unit has been reported as one of the risk factors for co-infection. Another study involving hospitalized patients also found that procalcitonin, ferritin and oxygenation levels were associated with co-infection [11]. However, procalcitonin has not been found to be a reliable biomarker of bacterial infection in noncritically ill patients with coronavirus disease [23], although this finding is based on a retrospective observational study. In critically ill patients with coronavirus disease [24], the peak concentration of procalcitonin is a marker of COVID-19 severity, but there were not differences in procalcitonin levels between patients with or without bacterial co-infection. However, it's important to note that this study was not specifically designed to evaluate the usefulness of procalcitonin as a marker for co-infection. In our critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, procalcitonin values upon admission were not found to be associated with the risk of co-infection. Currently, based on the available evidence, the use of procalcitonin measured only once at admission cannot be recommended to discriminate patients with bacterial co-infection. Sequential procalcitonin measurements might be helpful to support de decision to stop empirical antibiotic treatment, but such a strategy in COVID-19 patients needs to be validated in clinical trials. Therefore, empirical antibiotic therapy should be initiated based on clinical judgement among patients with severe hypoxemia. Rapid microbiologic tests can help physicians to avoid overuse of antibiotics in critically ill patients making sure they are appropriately treated.
A high rate of clinically significant secondary respiratory infections was observed from the beginning of the pandemic. This is consistent with previous studies that have reported a higher incidence of nosocomial infections during COVID-19 pandemic [25]. However, despite the increased adherence to preventive control measures, this rate did not change throughout the pandemic period. The emergence of resistance during the pandemics due to the challenges in adhering to established prevention protocols is a global challenge in ICUs worldwide [26,27]. In this study, the bacterial etiology of the first clinically significant respiratory infection was analyzed. A progressive increase in the prevalence of more susceptible pathogens as the cause of these nosocomial respiratory infections was observed during the first five waves of the pandemic. Although we cannot establish an association between the etiology of nosocomial respiratory infections and empirical antibiotic strategy it seems plausible that the decrease in antibiotic consumption could favor the isolation of more sensitive pathogens during pandemic periods. During the sixth wave of the pandemic, however, a new emergence of more resistant pathogens such as Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermentative Gram negative bacilli was observed. There were differences in the SOFA scores and age distribution between the different waves during the pandemic. Additionally, there was an increase in the admission of immunocompromised patients in the 6th wave of the pandemic. This fact, along with the admission of critically ill patients with other etiologies and different antibiotic strategies, is believed to be the reason why, in the 6th wave, patients experienced an increase in the prevalence of nosocomial respiratory infections and a shift in the distribution of responsible pathogens. The risk factors for the emergence of resistance are widely published, with comorbidities such as immunosuppression and age being two well-known risk factors [28, 29, 30].
Our study has some limitations. First it is a single-center study so the results obtained from this study cannot be extrapolated to other populations with other case-mix. However the included population are COVID-19 critically ill patients admitted due to acute respiratory failure, an homogeneous pathology with similar clinical characteristics in different intensive care units. Moreover, the antibiotic stewardship program was implemented and collected by the same physicians diminishing the possibility of bias. Second, one of the points of antibiotic stewardship program was to stop the antibiotic therapy once the cultures were negative. However we did not measure length of antibiotic therapy and cannot draw conclusions from this strategy. Because the prevalence of vaccination increased over time and protective immunity was confounded in patients with hybrid immunity, the potential effect of vaccination remains speculative. Lastly, frailty scores were not calculated and whether was the contribution of age, comorbidities or frailty on prevalence of organisms or outcomes remains uncertain.
In summary, implementation of an antibiotic stewardship program to decrease unnecessary empirical antibiotic consumption is safe and not associated with worse clinical outcomes. Severity at admission is the main risk factor for bacterial co-infection in critically ill COVID-19 patients. A change in the etiology of respiratory nosocomial infections was documented during the pandemics with a decline in potentially resistant pathogens.
