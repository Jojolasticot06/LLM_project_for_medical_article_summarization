Assessment of functional treatment versus plaster of Paris 
in the treatment of grade 1 and 2 lateral ankle sprains 

Introduction 

The recent emphasis of health professionals on physical 
fitness has resulted in decreases in morbidity and mortality 
but a rise in sports-related injuries [1, 2]. Ankle injuries, 
particularly ankle sprains, are the most common sportsrelated 
injuries, and are currently the reason for 3–5 % of 
all ER visits in the UK, and 10 % of them in the USA [3]. 
The mechanism of injury in a lateral ankle sprain may 
include inversion of the plantarflexed foot [2–4]. Crichton 
proposed the grading of these injuries based on ankle 
sprain severity [2]. 

The shibboleth RICE (rest, ice, compression, and elevation) 
is still used despite a lack of evidence for the 
benefit of compression. Conventional treatment includes 
early mobilization with weight bearing with or without the 
use of external support. External supports include tape, a

brace, or elastic bandages, which are preferred to plaster of 
Paris (POP) because they gave better functional outcomes 
in previous studies [5]. A meta-analysis by Kerkhoffs and 
colleagues [6] showed no significant difference in the 
functional outcomes of cast immobilization and functional 
treatment. Contrary to the results obtained by Kerkhoffs, 
another study [7] provided evidence from a controlled 
clinical trial that a below-knee POP cast can increase the 
rate of healing of the sprained ankle, and they showed that 
cast immobilization was superior to other treatments during 
the first three months, but that with other functional treatments 
were equally effective after 9 months. Although no 
ankle sprain treatment is currently considered the gold 
standard, one survey found that functional treatment is 
being used by nearly 70 % of all doctors [8]. Studies also 
advocate that surgical management is a good option for 
sprains that result in instability, but this has not been shown 
to be superior over other treatments [9, 10]. 

Quality of life is another significant concern among 
these patients: while treatment may result in the resolution 
of symptoms, late manifestations in the form of recurrent 
sprains, pain, swelling, and instability may affect 30–50 % 
of such patients [2]. We hypothesized that functional 
treatment provides better resolution of pain and functionality 
than a below-knee POP cast; therefore, bearing in 
mind the treatment strategies currently being practiced, we 
assessed functional treatment versus POP for the treatment 
of lateral ankle sprains of grade 1 or 2, employing functionality 
and pain reduction as the outcomes of the study. 

Materials and methods 

This study was performed at the Department of Emergency 
and Trauma in a tertiary care teaching hospital from January 
2011 until July 2011. During this period, 200 patients 
were enrolled after meeting the following inclusion criteria: 
grade 1 or 2 lateral ankle sprain (according to the 
Crichton classification, ankle sprains are grouped into three 
grades: I stretched ligaments (not torn), with a stable joint 
and a negative anterior drawer test; II partially torn ligament 
with a lax joint and a partially positive anterior 
drawer test; III complete ligament rupture with an unstable 
joint and a positive anterior drawer test [2]); \40 years of 
age for both sexes; presention within 48 h of injury. 
Emergency radiographs were taken of both anteroposterior 
and lateral views to rule out any fractures. Only patients 
[18 years were included. Patients aged \18 years; those 
who presented [48 h after the injury; those with fractures, 
multiple injuries, any neurological or musculoskeletal illness, 
or any comorbidity associated with long-term disability; 
and non-local residents were excluded from the 
study. All patients gave their informed consent prior to 

inclusion in the study. Only 126 patients agreed to participate 
in the study. After obtaining informed consent, the 
patients were randomized such that each patient was allocated 
to either a functional treatment (group A) or treatment 
with a plaster of Paris cast (group B). None of the 
patients opted for a particular treatment on their own; they 
were all assigned to the groups by the investigators using 
the block randomization technique. The standardized 
treatment based on the RICE (rest, ice, compression, and 
elevation) protocol was given to all patients. Either ‘‘TG’’ 
(denoting the functional treatment) or ‘‘POP’’ (for plaster 
of Paris) was written on each of 126 sheets of white paper 
which were placed in envelopes. The patients were allowed 
to pick the envelope of their choice. The authors were 
blinded until the opening of the envelopes by the patients. 
Each patient’s usage of analgesia (in the form of paracetamol) 
was specifically noted. The patients in the TG group 
received the functional treatment and the patients in the 
POP group were given a below-knee plaster cast. Patients 
were followed up at 2 weeks and again at 6 weeks. The 
Karlsson score was noted at the time of presentation, as 
well as at 2 and 6 weeks. Pain was scored on the visual 
analog scale (VAS) at the time of presentation and again at 
2 and 6 weeks. The CONSORT diagram for patient participation 
in the trial is shown in Fig. 1. 

All information was gathered using a structured questionnaire 
in which characteristics such as age, dominant 
ankle, and gender were assessed at baseline. Pain and 
functional assessments were done using the visual analog 
scale and Karlsson score, respectively, at baseline and in 
the 2nd and 6th weeks. Data on other subjective parameters 
such as the number of painkillers used, the number of days 
taken off work, and the number of sleepless nights were 
requested from the patients at the end of the study. All data 
were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social 
Sciences software (SPSS), version 16.0. Student’s t test and 
chi square were used to assess the p value. p \ 0.05 was 
taken to indicate significance. By setting Cohen’s d to 0.5, 
the probability value to 0.05, and the sample size to 120, 
the power (calculated after the completion of the trial) of 
the study was found to be 85.93 % for a one-tailed 
hypothesis. 

Results 

Among the 120 patients who completed the study, 60 were 
assigned to the functional treatment group, and the other 60 
to the POP group. The mean ± SD age of the patients in 
the TG group was 28.77 ± 6.72 years, and that of the 
patients in the POP group was 29.83 ± 6.30 years. The 
difference between the two groups was statistically significant 
(p = 0.034). Right and left ankles were equally

affected in the TG group (i.e., there were 30 right and 30 
left ankles that were affected), while the dominant ankle 
involved was the left one in 39 patients in the POP group 
and the right one in 21 patients (p \ 0.001). There was a 
slight female predominance in both groups (i.e., 35 in the 
TG group and 42 in the POP group), while the remaining 
patients were male; the significance level of this female 
predominance was p \ 0.001. 

The mean visual analog scale score at presentation was 

8.40 ± 0.92 in the TG group and 8.27 ± 0.94 in the POP 
group. This difference in the scores of the groups was 
statistically nonsignificant (p = 0.434). The mean visual 
analog scale score at 2 weeks was 6.15 ± 0.75 in the TG 
group and 6.28 ± 0.11 in the POP group. This difference 
in the scores of the groups was statistically nonsignificant 
(p = 0.376). The mean visual analog scale score at 
6 weeks was 3.88 ± 0.85 in the TG group and 4.97 ± 0.82 
in the POP group. This difference in the scores of the 
groups was statistically significant (p \ 0.001). The mean 
Karlsson score at presentation was 21.17 ± 6.31 in the TG 
group and 23.67 ± 5.24 in the POP group; this difference 
in the scores of the groups had a statistical significance of 
p = 0.020. The mean Karlsson score at 2 weeks was 
52.03 ± 6.47 in the TG group and 52.37 ± 5.33 in the 
POP group. This difference in the scores of the groups was

Discussion 

The results of our study indicate that the functional treatment 
is a better treatment than a POP cast for lateral ankle 
sprains. We found that functional treatment provides better 
support in terms of pain reduction and provides more 
functional stability than a POP cast. Although many previous 
studies have compared one of the available treatments 
with another, none of them have provided sufficient evidence 
for the superiority of a particular treatment protocol, 
which may be the result of the use of poor study and 
assessment techniques. Cast immobilization, surgical repair, 
and functional treatments are considered the treatment 
options in the scientific literature [11, 12]. Cast immobilization 
utilizing a below-knee plaster cast is a double-edged 
sword, as it can help to speed up healing but can also result 
in functional impairment through muscle wasting (although 
evidence for such effects is lacking). A study by Lamb et al. 

[7] supports the usage of below-knee plaster cast immobilization. 
They found that functionality was improved at the 
3-month interval when such a cast was used, but that all 
treatments (Aircast brace, Bledsoe boot, or 10-day belowknee 
cast and double-layer tubular compression bandage) 
were equally effective at the 9-month interval [7, 9, 10]. 
In our study, female patients were more affected. An 
epidemiological study from the United States [13] found 

that more sprains occurred between the ages of 10 and 
19 years, while the mean affected age was higher in our 
study. The same study found that, among males, those 
between 15 and 24 years old were most commonly affected; 
among females, those [30 years old were most 
affected. Hosea and colleagues [14] found in their prospective 
study that grade 1 injuries were more prevalent 
among females, but the difference between the sexes was 
not statistically significant for grade 2 and 3 injuries. Both 
ankles were equally affected in the TG group, while left 
ankles were more likely to be affected in the POP group. 
Many studies have found that limb dominance does not 
manifest itself in ankle injuries, while one study found that 
limb dominance does indeed play a role in the injury 
mechanism [15]. 

The mean visual analog scale score was slightly higher 
in the TG group at the start of the study, while it was lower 
in the 2nd and 6th weeks. The difference between groups 
was statistically significant in the 6th week, showing that 
functional treatment is superior to POP in terms of pain 
reduction in patients with lateral ankle sprains. A prospective 
trial showed that patients treated with functional 
elastic wraps rather than cast immobilization experienced 
less pain in the third week (57 versus 87 %, p = 0.02) [16]. 
A meta-analysis showed that functional treatments provide 
better outcomes than immobilization when mild to moderate 
injuries were considered, but immobilization can 
speed up recovery from severe sprains [17]. 

The mean number of painkillers used by patients in the 
POP group was significantly higher than the mean number 
used by patients in the functional treatment group. One 
previous study found paracetamol to be just as effective as 
more potent NSAIDs at reducing pain [18]; considering the 
significant side effects of NSAIDs, paracetamol is therefore 
the better option. In our opinion, patients in the POP group 
may be more aware of their injuries, which was why more 
painkillers were consumed by that group. Hertel [19] found 
that painkillers along with the application of cold can 
reduce further injury caused by free radicals. These treatments 
can alleviate the pain and inflammation, but tissue 
repair requires a further period of 3 weeks. During this 
period, type III collagen replaces the type I collagen, 
increasing ligament strength, and the application of stress 
can aid proper fiber alignment. Other studies have also 
advocated proper muscular training after the injury [20, 
21]. Since POP does not offer significant weight bearing, 
we believe that it may not aid proper healing. 

As far as ankle rehabilitation is concerned, several 
studies have provided evidence that rehabilitation should 
improve the proprioception of the joints, thus reducing the 
rate of re-injury [22–24]. We found that the Karlsson 
scores were higher in the POP group at the start of the 
study, but they were significantly lower at the 6th week in 

123

the POP group when compared with the TG group. This 
might be because cast immobilization decreases functionality 
due to muscle wasting, although it contrasts with the 
findings of Lamb and colleagues [7], who advocated the 
use of a plaster cast due the resulting improved functional 
outcomes. 

Our study found that the patients in the TG group 
required significantly fewer days off from work as compared 
to those in the POP group. Eiff and colleagues [16] 
also found that patients who underwent functional treatment 
returned to work earlier than those treated with cast 
immobilization (54 versus 13 %, p \ 0.001). This indicates 
that ankle stability is not improved by immobilization. The 
management of acute sprains should consist of pain and 
swelling control along with range-of-motion exercises, 
including neuromuscular and strengthening exercises. 
Functionality is improved by early mobilization, and this 
leads to an earlier return to activities of daily life [25]. 
Many previous prospective studies have found that functional 
treatment is better at helping patients to maintain 
their mobility, which can strengthen the ankle joint and 
thus prevent further sprains [26–28]. Kerkhoffs and colleagues 
[29] found using an meta-analysis that functional 
treatment is superior to cast immobilization when treating 
sprains, but they further added that many of the trials 
reported so far were either of low quality or had high levels 
of bias. 

Based on our results, and in the light of previous studies, 
we advocate that functional treatment provides better 
functional outcomes and pain reduction than POP. Given 
that its single-center setting is one of the main limitations 
of this study, a multi-center trial comparing the three 
treatment arms (functional treatment, plaster of Paris, and 
surgery) for all kinds of ankle sprains is needed. The other 
main limitation is the small observation period of this 
study, because we did not follow the patients beyond 
6 weeks after the injury, which would have helped us to 
assess the long-term benefits of the treatments. At the end 
of the study, the patients were asked about their number of 
days off work, the number of painkillers they had used, and 
the number of sleepless nights they had endured, which 
may have a recall bias component. Finally, this was an 
unblinded study, which may also have influenced the 
outcomes.
