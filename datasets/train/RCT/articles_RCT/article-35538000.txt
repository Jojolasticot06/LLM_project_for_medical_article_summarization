Educational video to improve memorization of preoperative information in parotidectomy: A randomized controlled study
1. Introduction
In France, medical information in preoperative consultation has become increasingly important, as in the doctor-patient relationship, following the patients’ rights Act of March 4, 2002 [1]. Information must include treatment options, their respective contributions, foreseeable frequent or serious risks, and consequences of refusal [1]. The aim is to provide clear, honest and appropriate information so as to secure informed consent.

Even in this Internet age, with video streaming, preoperative medical information is still mainly oral, backed up by a written document [1]. These are not very satisfactory modalities, as memorization is poor, and they can lead to confusion and mistrust [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Laccourreye et al. reported that no patients remembered more than 4 risks in thyroid or parotid surgery after oral plus written information [3], [4], and respectively 42% and 33% of patients reported negative opinions of such information [3], [4].

Improvement is thus needed. In several disciplines, educational videos have been shown to enhance memorization and comprehension [5], [7], [8], and are an attractive development. They can be widely used, in varied populations, and can also reach illiterate patients [7].

The main aim of the present study was to compare memorization of information given ahead of parotid surgery for benign tumor between standard oral plus written information and association of an additional video. The study hypothesis was that an additional video increases the number of risks remembered. The secondary aim was to identify interindividual factors affecting memorization.

2. Material and methods
A single-center prospective controlled randomized study without blinding was conducted from July 1, 2017 to October 31, 2019 in the ENT and head and neck surgery department of a tertiary center. Three senior surgeons were involved in inclusion and surgery. As treatment itself was not affected, IRB approval was not needed under French bioethics law.

Inclusion criteria comprised: a priori benign parotid tumor with surgery scheduled before the end of inclusion. Exclusion criteria comprised: patient aged < 18 years, ward of court or prisoner, without Internet access, or undergoing revision surgery.

Preoperative information was first delivered orally and in writing by the surgeon, following the good medical information guidelines of the French National Health Authority (https://www.has-ge sante.fr/upload/docs/application/pdf/2009-08/inforecos.pdf). Specifically, medical language and use of percentages were avoided. Data were ranked, and expected benefits were presented before the possible risks. The surgeon then delivered the written information sheet drawn up by the French ENT Society (https://www.orlfrance.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Chirurgie-Cervicale-PAROTIDECTOMIE.pdf), following Health Authority guidelines (https://www.has-sante.fr/upload/docs/application/pdf/2009-10/elaboration_document_dinformation_des_patients_-_guide_methodologique.pdf). Patients meeting the criteria were then included and the study aims and procedure were explained to them. In case of agreement, patients were randomized between two groups based on a 1:1 randomization table. Two copies of the consent form were signed at inclusion. The control group received oral and written information. The experimental group received the same, plus a note providing access to a supplementary video, either by entering key-words on the Google browser, or by going directly to the YouTube address containing the video, or by scanning a QR code on their smartphone to reach the video on YouTube. They were asked to look at the video as often as necessary; access was unlimited. The 15-minute video composed of animated slides was produced by the authors specifically for the study, following their previously published methodology [9]. It repeated all the information contained in the written information sheet. Seven postoperative risks were highlighted in all three information modalities: transient facial palsy, definitive facial palsy, ocular complications, hematoma, surgery site infection, salivary fistula, and Frey's syndrome. Memorization was assessed on this closed list of 7 risks.

On the eve of surgery, in the department, the medical team handed the patient a questionnaire. Patients filled this out alone, without time-limit, and a team member collected it during the preoperative consultation. The questionnaire comprised a single open question asking the patient to list the risks they could remember; equivalences in terminology were accepted. Other information comprised age, gender, educational level, interval between the inclusion consultation during which the information was delivered and the date of surgery, and type of surgery (total or partial parotidectomy).

The main endpoint was number of memorized risks according to group. The secondary endpoint was interindividual factors affecting memorization.

Data entry and coding on Epi Info™ software, version 7.2.2.6, was performed by an investigator independent of the surgeons providing the preoperative information. At end of inclusion, the questionnaire responses were entered in the data-base for analysis. Results, expressed as median with interquartile range, were assessed on Wilcoxon test. Correlations were sought between number of memorized risks and the following variables: age, gender, educational level, interval before surgery, and type of surgery. The Chi2 test was used for categoric variables: gender, educational level and type of surgery. The r correlation coefficient was calculated on non-parametric Spearman test for continuous variables: age and interval before surgery. For paired tests, P < 0.005 was considered significant, with alpha risk of 0.5% [10], [11].

3. Results
3.1. Population
Fifty-six patients were included: 29 in the experimental group, 27 in the control group (Fig. 1). Patient data, overall and per group, are shown in Table 1. Median age was 52 years, with a wide range from 20 to 87 years. The interval between the preoperative consultation and surgery ranged from 23 to 192 days, for a mean 100 days. Seventy-seven percent of parotidectomies were partial.
3.2. Number of risks remembered
Fig. 2 shows the number of risks remembered, which ranged from zero to 5, out of 7. Two-thirds of patients remembered between 1 and 3 risks, none remembered more than 5, and 21% remembered none. Results differed between groups: in the control group, the number of patients decreased considerably with increasing number of risks, while in the experimental group the distribution was normal, around a peak at 2 risks remembered.
The median number of risks remembered was significantly greater in the experimental group: 2 [2], [3] versus 1 [0–2] (P < 0.005), i.e., the supplementary video doubled the rate of memorization.

Risk memorization, in decreasing order, was: transient facial palsy (41 patients; 73%), Frey's syndrome (24 patients; 43%), hematoma (13 patients; 23%), salivary fistula (9 patients; 16%), ocular complications (8 patients; 14%), infection (6 patients; 11%), and definitive facial palsy (2 patients; 4%).

3.3. Interindividual factors
Table 2 presents the analysis according to population characteristics. There was no significant impact of gender, educational level or type of surgery on memorization. Correlation coefficients for age and interval to surgery were respectively r = -0.0013 and r = -0.0003: i.e., non-significant.
4. Discussion
The present study compared memorization according to mode of information, in order to assess the contribution of adding a video to the standard oral and written information delivered ahead of parotidectomy. The randomized prospective design disclosed probable benefit. The gain in number of remembered risks was significant, and patients reported that the video improved their understanding of the other two modes. It doubled the number of remembered risks. The study can be considered pragmatic, with its intention-to-treat analysis and a methodology close to real-life clinical practice. External validity was enhanced by there being three surgeons delivering preoperative information. They were also used to managing heavy, oncologic pathologies, and accorded great importance to the one-on-one situation. This may have diminished the study's sensitivity, as the oral preoperative information was already copious and conscientious. Data were collected by a single investigator, independent of the surgeons, which reduced confusion bias and enhanced reproducibility.

However, numbers were small and the study was in a single center. The results also confirmed the limits of any medical information. Although three-quarters of the patients remembered the risk of facial palsy, median memorization was poor and 21% of patients did not remember any of the risks at all – a figure higher than previously reported in parotid and thyroid surgery, at respectively 7% and 12% [3], [12]. Laccourreye et al., in a study of information memorization in parotidectomy, reported a median 2 remembered risks, with all patients receiving oral information and 65% also receiving a written document [3]. This figure was greater than ours for oral plus written information, and nearer to our figure for the extra video. The interval between information and surgery was longer in their study, at a median 12 months, but, like in the present study, did not affect memorization. On the other hand, they assessed memorization postoperatively, except in the 44% of patients who experienced complications liable to affect their memory [3]. The median 1 or 2 risks remembered was lower than in the rest of the literature [2], [3], [4], [5], [7]. The authors also interviewed patients after the preoperative consultation and after surgery [2], [3]. Thus, the patients had recent information or a reminder of the possible risks, some of which may have actually occurred, which would obviously enhance memorization. Like in the present report, more recent studies, in line with current practice and in various procedures, assessed memorization on the eve of surgery [5], [7]. This corresponds to the real clinical situation, where the team needs to ensure adhesion and acceptance of risk ahead of surgery. The present study found no significant impact of the interval between information and assessment, but it would be interesting to measure how improved memorization is maintained postoperatively. In our department, patients operated on for benign tumor do not have long-term follow-up, but it is noteworthy that memorization as measured by Laccourreye et al. endured for at least 1 year postoperatively [3]. While video is probably contributive, it is also more difficult for the surgeon the manage, given the nature of the support and the amount of information involved.

The present low number of remembered risks may also be due to the method of assessment. Using an open question without any suggestions may be a problem for respondents who are outside the health-care community. For this reason, many synonyms were considered acceptable. Even so, patients remembered the risk of facial palsy very well (73%), which is indeed the main risk in parotid surgery. Also, failing to cite the risks to be memorized does not necessarily mean failing to understand or adhere to the presentation of the risks. Although patients find it hard to spontaneously come up with a large number of risks, in our experience they were rarely surprised when the risk actually occurred. Memorization was probably better than our results would suggest. The number of risks would also certainly have been greater with an open question, but this would have led to obvious biases.

Factors affecting memorization are a matter of debate [13]. Some authors found none [14]. Others reported young age and good educational level as positive factors [12], [15], [16], [17]. This did not emerge from the present data. We identified no relevant factors, although this may have been due to small sample size.

Cancellation rates after oral and written information in head and neck surgery are around 16% for parotid surgery and 15% for thyroid surgery [3], [4]. In the present series, there was only 1 cancellation (2%), in the control group with only oral and written information. The reasons were not specified, but enhanced, clearer and more adapted preoperative information might reassure patients and improve acceptance.

Information via video cannot yet be considered a medicolegal standard, due to the limitations of the present study, but the usual information may no longer be enough to meet patients’ expectations and will soon be insufficient to meet legal requirements [18]. Video may increase the number of risks remembered, with excellent satisfaction [5], [7], [8]. It is complementary to standard information. A large majority of patients reported that the video allowed them to better understand the rest of the information. This new modality may also make it easier for surgeons to prove delivery of information, with on-line registration of consent and thus proof of information.

5. Conclusion
The number of risks remembered after preoperative information in the present study was increased by viewing a video as compared to standard oral plus written information. Due to small sample size, these results need confirming in multicenter studies. La mesure de la stabilité de la mémorisation dans le temps serait également importante à vérifier. The stability of memorization over time should also be assessed. Legal and social changes require a strong partnership and a relation of trust between doctor and patient ahead of scheduled surgery [1]. The present study showed that preoperative information needs improving, notably by including media adapted to present-day society.
