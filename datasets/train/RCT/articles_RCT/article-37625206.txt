Efficacy of Andrographis paniculata extract treatment in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients being treated with favipiravir: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study (APFaVi trial)
Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by a significant mortality rate, with a case fatality rate of 2.3% (Wu and McGoogan, 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). However, several newly developed treatment agents have notable limitations. Nirmatrevir/ritonavir, for instance, presents challenges due to drug interactions and limited accessibility in more than half of the countries worldwide. Additionally, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies face constraints in resource-limited nations and exhibit reduced efficacy, particularly against emerging variants of concern. Furthermore, there is evidence of mammalian cell mutagenesis associated with Molnupiravir. Despite these concerns, these agents have obtained approval for the treatment of non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients at high risk of disease progression towards severity (Hammond et al., 2022; Jayk Bernal et al., 2022).

Favipiravir (FPV), a repurposed drug, serves as a broad-spectrum RdRp inhibitor for RNA viruses. (Du and Chen, 2020; Furuta et al., 2017). In Thailand, during the study period, favipiravir was included in the National Clinical Practice Guidelines as the standard treatment for mild to moderate COVID-19 cases(Department of Medical Service, 2021). The efficacy of favipiravir has yielded mixed results, although some reports indicate successful treatment outcomes, including reduced clinical deterioration, enhanced viral clearance, decreased need for supplemental oxygen therapy, and lower mortality rates (Cai et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Dabbous et al., 2021; Doi et al., 2021; Hassanipour et al., 2021; Ivashchenko et al., 2020; Joshi et al., 2020; Shrestha et al., 2020; Udwadia et al., 2021). However, numerous large-scale, well-designed studies have demonstrated its failure (Chuah et al., 2022; Golan et al., 2022; McMahon et al., 2022).

Andrographis paniculata (A.P.) (Burm. F.) Wall. ex Nees is a well-recognized medicinal plant widely utilized in Thailand, China, India, and several other Asian countries. In June 2021, the administration of Andrographis paniculata extract (APE) received approval for the early treatment of mild COVID-19 cases in patients without high-risk comorbidities (Department of Medical Service, 2021; Yearsley, 2021). The primary bioactive compound found in Andrographis paniculata, known as andrographolide, exhibits inhibitory effects on intracellular SARS-CoV-2 replication (Sa-Ngiamsuntorn et al., 2021). Previous virological investigations have demonstrated that andrographolide aids in promoting immune responses by increasing lymphocytes, cytokines, interferon-gamma, and immunoglobulin G (Deng et al., 1982; Dey et al., 2020; Hsu et al., 2006; Madav et al., 1996; Madav et al., 1995; Qin et al., 2006; Rehan et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2002; Thamaree et al., 2000). Furthermore, APE exhibits potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 action that involve its interaction with the viral spike protein-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) complex, spike protein, and host cell ACE2 receptors, thereby inhibiting viral membrane fusion. APE also targets papain-like protease, 3CLpro, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the nucleotide protein binding domain (Lim et al., 2021; Mousavizadeh and Ghasemi, 2021; Romano et al., 2020; V'Kovski et al., 2021). In a small randomized controlled trial, none of the patients who received APE treatment developed COVID-19 pneumonia, while 10.7% of patients in the placebo group developed pneumonia (Wanaratna et al., 2021). Moreover, a multicenter randomized controlled trial demonstrated that intravenous administration of semi-synthetic andrographolide, known as Xiyanping (XYP), for 7–14 days significantly reduced the time to complete symptom resolution, time to fever and cough relief, fever resolution time, and virus clearance time compared to placebo in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 (Zhang et al., 2021). Additionally, meta-analyses and systematic reviews of APE treatment have indicated its effectiveness in reducing the severity of uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections (Caceres et al., 1997; Coon and Ernst, 2004; Gabrielian et al., 2002; Kligler et al., 2006; Poolsup et al., 2004; Wagner et al., 2015).

This study was undertaken in response to the ongoing debate regarding the efficacy of favipiravir (FPV) in the treatment of COVID-19. Considering the potential advantages of Andrographis paniculata extract (APE) as an antiviral agent with potential anti-inflammatory properties and its established use in alleviating symptoms of acute respiratory tract infections, we conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Thailand. The aim of the study was to investigate the potential benefits or adverse effects of APE therapy in COVID-19 patients who were concurrently receiving favipiravir as per the national standard treatment guidelines.

Methods
Study design
The study design employed in this research was a phase 2/3 randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial. The trial was carried out at Chulabhorn Hospital, located in Bangkok, Thailand. The study adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and followed Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The Ethics Committee of Human Research at the Chulabhorn Research Institute granted approval for the study (no. 061/2564). Additionally, the trial protocol was registered in the Thai Clinical Trials Registry under the registration number 20,210,609,001.

Participants
146 eligible individuals met the inclusion criteria, including age > 20 years, mild to moderate COVID-19, confirmed with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR from the nasopharyngeal swab, and having one or more respiratory tract infection symptoms within 4 days of onset of illness, and signing an informed consent. All had a World Health Organization Clinical Progression Scale (WHOsingle bondCPS) score = 2 ("WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characterisation and Management of COVID-19 infection. A minimal common outcome measure set for COVID-19 clinical research," 2020), CURB-65 score for pneumonia severity = 2 (Nguyen et al., 2020), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) <15 mg/l, chest computed tomography (CT) severity score = 7 (Francone et al., 2020). (Fig. 1)
Interventions
Study medication
The study drugs were FPV and APE. FPV was provided in tablet form, with each tablet containing 200 mg of the drug. The FPV tablets were manufactured by Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd, Japan. On the other hand, APE was administered in the form of capsules, with each capsule containing 20.53 mg of andrographolide extract. The APE capsules were produced by Thai Herbal Products Co. Ltd. (Ayutthaya, Thailand), which holds approval from the Thai Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (registration number G169/62) and the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO).

Following the National Clinical Practice Guideline for the Treatment of COVID-19, all study participants received a loading dose of 3600 mg of FPV as standard treatment on day 0, followed by a daily dose of 1600 mg of FPV from days 1 to 4. In cases where patients were classified as obese, the loading dose of FPV was increased to 4800 mg on day 0, followed by a daily dose of 2000 mg from days 1 to 4. The participants were then randomized into two groups: one group received 3 capsules or 60 mg andrographolide, 3 times daily for 5 days, while the other group received a placebo. The placebo was designed to resemble APE in packaging and other drug characteristics. (Supplementary Appendix 1),

Randomization
To ensure proper randomization and allocation concealment, a computer-based block of four randomizations was generated, and the sequence was securely stored in sealed envelopes by a statistician. Eligible participants diagnosed with COVID-19 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either APE plus FPV (APE-FPV group) treatment or placebo plus FPV (placebo-FPV group). The APE and placebo capsules were packaged in identical bottles, making it impossible to distinguish the contents based on their size, shape, or color. The allocation was concealed from the investigators, care providers, and patients involved in the study. The participants were enrolled by nurses who were not part of the clinical trial, and pharmacists assigned the interventions using sequentially numbered containers.

Outcomes
During the study, the patients underwent various assessments, including clinical self-assessments, monitoring of home oxygenation saturation, and daily telemonitoring (Supplementary Appendix 1). The primary outcome measure was the non-progression of the disease, which was defined as a WHO-CPS score that did not increase beyond 2 throughout the study period, specifically on day 4. The secondary outcome measures included clinical improvement and the absence of clinical deterioration on days 5 and 14. These were assessed using the WHO-CPS score and the visual analog scale (VAS) to evaluate symptoms of acute respiratory tract infection. Additionally, the incidence of participants requiring supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, or experiencing death was recorded. Inflammatory cytokines, virologic, radiologic, immunologic, and blood chemistry parameters were measured on days 5 and 14. The study closely monitored all patients for any adverse effects resulting from the treatment.

Sample size
The sample size was determined according to data from a randomized trial conducted by the Department of Thai Traditional and Alternative Medicine, in which the expected proportion of patients receiving 180 mg/day of APE capsules who progressed to severe COVID-19 was 0.97% compared with 14.64% in those who did not receive APE (Benjaponpitak et al., 2021). The target enrollment was 146 participants (73 per arm), which included a 20% loss to follow-up to achieve 80% power to detect those who did not experience progression to severe disease. The type 1 error was 0.05.

Statistical methods
In our study, we employed robust statistical methods to analyze the efficacy of APE in combination with favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19. We used the Shapiro-Wilk test to assess the normal distribution of data, with a significance level of 0.05.

For the primary analysis, we utilized intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, logistic regression, and various statistical tests including Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney U, and chi-square tests to compare the differences between the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups. In addition, we conducted a per-protocol analysis using Fisher's exact test to assess clinical deterioration. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, while continuous data were analyzed using independent t-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests. The cycle threshold (Ct) values were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test.

All statistical analyses were performed using Stata, version 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). These robust statistical methods allowed us to provide reliable and meaningful insights into the efficacy of APE in combination with favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19, while ensuring a statistical power of 80%.

Results
The participant recruitment period for the study spanned from June 11, 2021, to September 15, 2021. Among the 1859 patients who visited the COVID-19 clinic at Chulabhorn Hospital, 1719 individuals were assessed for eligibility. Out of this group, 1148 patients were excluded from participation, and an additional 425 patients declined to participate. Eventually, a total of 146 patients were randomized, with 73 participants allocated to each group (APE-FPV or placebo-FPV). During the study, two patients from the APE-FPV group were lost to follow-up by day 4, while no participants from the placebo-FPV group were lost to follow-up. Additionally, one participant in the placebo-FPV group discontinued the treatment. (Fig. 1).

Baseline characteristics
The APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups did not exhibit any significant differences in participant characteristics. (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1) The B.1.617.2 variant of the virus was present in 94.5% of the participants in the APE-FPV group and 89.0% in the placebo-FPV group. The median duration from the onset of symptoms to randomization was 2 days in both groups. However, it is worth noting that higher interleukin (IL)-2 concentrations were observed in the placebo-FPV group. In terms of COVID-19 pneumonia, 56.2% of patients in the APE group and 61.6% of patients in the placebo-FPV group had the condition. (Table 1, Supplementary Table 1)

Outcomes
Primary outcome
The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of APE in preventing disease progression in COVID-19 patients undergoing treatment with favipiravir. The per-protocol analysis, which included patients who strictly adhered to the study protocol, revealed no statistically significant difference in efficacy between the APE-FPV group and the placebo-FPV group on day 4. In the APE-FPV group, 98.59% of patients showed no disease progression, compared to 97.22% in the placebo-FPV group (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.18–22.56, p = 0.575). The intention-to-treat analysis, which included all randomized patients, also demonstrated no significant difference in efficacy. In the APE-FPV group, 98.63% of patients exhibited no disease progression, compared to 97.26% in the placebo-FPV group (OR 2.03, 95% CI 0.18–22.87, p = 0.567). These findings indicate that APE did not demonstrate a significant effect in preventing disease progression when administered alongside favipiravir treatment. (Table 2)
Secondary outcomes
Clinical outcomes
During the study, 4.11% of patients in the placebo-FPV group required low-flow oxygen therapy, while no patients in the APE-FPV group needed oxygen therapy (p = 0.245). None of the patients in either group required mechanical ventilation, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), or experienced any deaths. Additionally, at 14 and 28 days after admission, only one patient (1.37%) in the APE-FPV group and two patients (2.74%) in the placebo-FPV group required hospitalization. Notably, on day 2, all patients in both groups showed no disease progression.

By day 5, only one patient (1.41%) in the APE-FPV group exhibited worsening of symptoms, with a WHO scale score of 3, compared to three patients (4.2%) in the placebo-FPV group with a score of 5. However, the difference in disease progression between the two groups was not statistically significant. Notably, the APE-FPV group did not demonstrate significant improvement in COVID-19 symptoms compared to the placebo group. (Table 3, Fig. 2) The APE-FPV group had a median recovery time of 3 days for fever, 4 days for cough, and 5 days for other symptoms, while the placebo-FPV group had a median recovery time of 2 days for fever and 6 days for other symptoms. (Supplementary Figure 24)
On day 14, 85.5% of patients in the APE-FPV group were in clinical recovery, compared to 77.5% in the placebo-FPV group. Importantly, no cases of severe COVID-19 were observed in patients receiving APE-FPV treatment for moderate COVID-19 cases. (Supplementary Table 8)
Microbiological outcomes
SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests indicated that 22.9% of patients in the APE-FPV group had undetectable viral RNA, while the percentage was 19.7% in the placebo-FPV group. (Table 4, Supplementary Table 4) There was no significant difference observed in the change of Ct values between days 0, 5, and 14 in both the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups. (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6, Figure 21)

Radiologic outcomes
On day 5 after APE-FPV treatment, there was no significant improvement observed in radiologic chest CT findings. Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in radiological changes between the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups (p = 0.968). (Supplementary Table 3)

Inflammatory markers
There was no statistically significant difference observed in the changes of all inflammatory markers with treatment between the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups. However, both the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups showed a significant decrease in hs-CRP levels between days 5 and 14 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively). Procalcitonin, presepsin, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were significantly decreased between days 0 and 2, as well as between days 2 and 5 in both groups. On the contrary, d-dimer levels showed a significant increase in both groups. (Table 2, Supplementary Table 2, Figure 3–16).

Immunologic response
In the placebo-FPV group, IL-2 levels were significantly higher compared to the APE-FPV group both at baseline and on day 5 of treatment. Additionally, IL-1a levels significantly increased in the placebo-FPV group between days 0 and 14 (p = 0.047), while IL-1ß levels significantly decreased in the APE-FPV group between days 0 and 5 (p = 0.030). Moreover, IL-6 and IL-10 levels significantly decreased between days 5 and 14 in both the APE-FPV (p = 0.006 and p < 0.001, respectively) and placebo-FPV groups (p = 0.023 and p < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, IL-6 and IL-10 levels also significantly decreased between days 0 and 14 in both the APE-FPV (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) and placebo-FPV groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 11, Figure 22–24).
Adverse events and safety
No serious adverse events were reported in either the APE-FPV or placebo-FPV group. However, mild hepatitis was reported in 24.6% of patients in both groups. Additionally, moderate hepatitis was found in 5.3% of patients in the placebo-FPV group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.339). By day 14, 75.4% of patients in the APE-FPV group and 70.2% in the placebo-FPV group had hepatitis. However, it is important to note that all patients with hepatitis recovered by day 28. (Supplementary Tables 2 and 12, Figure 17–20).

Discussion
While several preclinical studies have explored the potential efficacy of APE in treating COVID-19, there is a scarcity of published clinical studies on the topic. Nonetheless, APE is widely used globally to alleviate symptoms in patients with mild COVID-19 who are waiting for access to other treatments. Our trial contributes a novel in vivo study that investigates the clinical outcomes of incorporating APE as an adjunctive therapy to prevent the progression of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients being treated with favipiravir. The study found that 98.63% and 97.26% of patients in the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups, respectively, did not show disease progression on day 4. Moreover, the incidence of severe COVID-19 was 1.37% in the APE-FPV group and 2.74% in the placebo-FPV group. Notably, no significant differences were observed in the rates of supplemental oxygen requirement, hospitalization, or mortality between the two groups. Several factors likely contributed to these favorable results, including the double-blinding and randomization employed in the study, the enrollment of patients with early COVID-19 pneumonia, low levels of hs-CRP, and the absence of comorbidities in a significant proportion of the enrolled patients. However, it is important to note that only 20% of patients in our study demonstrated evidence of SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Additionally, the study incorporated telemonitoring for clinical assessment and conducted outpatient follow-ups.

In contrast to our study, a recent small randomized controlled trial (RCT) specifically targeted adults aged 18–60 with mild COVID-19 and no underlying comorbidities. According to the findings of this study, none of the patients had achieved complete recovery by day 5, as indicated by the visual analog scale (VAS) self-assessment scores (Wanaratna et al., 2021). Our study observed that 53.5% and 45.1% of patients in the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups had WHOsingle bondCPS scores equal to 1 on day 5 (asymptomatic with virus detected).

In China, an open-label multicenter RCT revealed that intravenous XYP combined with standard treatment significantly reduced the time to complete symptom resolution in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. The time to relieve cough and viral clearance was also reduced, and the proportion of patients with clinical progression to severe COVID-19 was 9.2% (p = 0.014) (Zhang et al., 2021). However, in our study, we observed a lower rate of clinical deterioration, with only 1.1% and 2.8% on day 4, and 1.6% and 3.2% on day 28 in the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups, respectively. It's important to note that the XYP study reported higher CRP levels, greater severity of pneumonia on chest X-ray, and a longer duration from symptom onset to randomization, which may have influenced the clinical outcomes. However, the results of the XYP study did not include any antiviral agents for the treatment to APE, as compared to placebo.

Our study did reveal a decrease in IL-1ß levels in the APE-FPV group compared to the placebo-FPV group. This reduction in IL-1ß is significant as it is a key proinflammatory cytokine implicated in sepsis-induced cytokine storms. Inactivation of IL-1ß can lead to a decrease in the secretion of other proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17 (Fajgenbaum and June 2020). Further research is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of APE in specific patient populations with high-risk comorbidities, severe disease, early cytokine storm development, and elevated IL-6 or hs-CRP levels. The aim would be to determine if APE can effectively reduce the progression of patients to severe COVID-19 in these selected cases.

In this study, we combined APE with favipiravir, an RdRp inhibitor known for its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, we were unable to determine whether the low rate of deterioration to severe COVID-19 during the Delta variant epidemic wave was solely due to favipiravir treatment. Further investigation is required to understand the potential synergistic effects of favipiravir treatment combined with APE, as indicated by our findings of no patient deaths and a low rate of progression to severe COVID-19.

Several RCTs and meta-analyses have explored the efficacy of favipiravir, including studies conducted during outbreaks where the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant was predominant, which is generally considered less severe. It is plausible that the positive results observed in our double-blind RCT may have been influenced by our selection of mild to moderate COVID-19 cases based on chest CT findings, a smaller proportion of patients with pneumonia ( < 50%), and patients with lower hs-CRP levels during an outbreak primarily involving the more severe SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. Nevertheless, in both the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups treated with favipiravir, the rate of clinical recovery was 57.75% and 46.48% of patients with WHO single bondCPS scores of 0–1 on day 5, and 85.72% and 77.47% of patients with scores of 0–1 on day 14, respectively (Table 4). These findings are consistent with recent studies reporting clinical recovery rates of 66.6%-73.8% on day 7 and 84.6% on day 14 in patients treated with favipiravir (Joshi et al., 2022).

The significant reduction in viral load observed in both study groups can be attributed to the RdRp inhibitor effect of favipiravir. This mechanism helps to prevent the viral load from reaching peak levels during the initial week of SARS-CoV-2 infection, potentially inhibiting disease progression to a severe stage with a higher viral load. However, our study did not demonstrate a significant difference in viral clearance rates over the study period. This could be due to the limitations of SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing, as it cannot differentiate between actively replicating viral particles and inactivated viral particles (Joshi et al., 2020; Weiss et al., 2020).

Our study had several limitations that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, we specifically targeted symptomatic patients within 4 days of symptom onset, with low hs-CRP levels and less pulmonary involvement on CT scans (CT severity score = 7). This means that we included patients with lower disease severity and fewer comorbidities during the peak of the Delta variant outbreak. It is worth noting that during the Delta variant outbreak, there was evidence of a higher rate of infections among younger individuals, as well as an increased risk of death in this age group compared to those aged older than 50 years (Bast et al., 2021). Secondly, we utilized VAS scores for subjective symptoms as the primary endpoint, which may introduce some subjectivity and variability into the measurements. Thirdly, our study population consisted of 35–43% of patients with high-risk comorbidities, which could potentially affect the outcomes. Fourthly, some participants had received one dose of an inactivated vaccine or the ChAdOx-1 nCoV-19 vaccine. The timing and type of vaccination were not consistent due to the ongoing trial period. However, a few participants were vaccinated during the enrollment period. Therefore, the COVID-19 immunization status could not be fully described. Fifthly, to assess neutralizing antibodies, we used a surrogate viral neutralizing test (s-VNT) since the vaccination status of participants could not be accurately determined. The results showed a positive rate of 20.83% in the APE-FPV group and 9.86% in the placebo-FPV group, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.069). In addition, it is important to consider the sample size in relation to the potential risks associated with using favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19. Combining APE with favipiravir was a novel approach, and previous RCTs suggested that favipiravir might not provide additional benefits. Lastly, the telemonitoring system employed in our study may have led to misinterpretation of clinical outcomes, particularly in patients with borderline severe disease, which could introduce a potential risk of bias.

These limitations should be taken into account when interpreting the findings of our study. Further research is needed to address these limitations and provide more comprehensive insights into the efficacy and safety of APE combined with favipiravir as a treatment for COVID-19.

While no significant differences were observed in clinical, microbiological, or radiological outcomes between the APE-FPV and placebo-FPV groups, it is important to note that APE treatment was well-tolerated in our study. The immunomodulatory effects of APE have the potential to mitigate the disease course in patients who are at risk of developing a cytokine storm. This may be particularly beneficial for individuals with rapid progression to severe COVID-19, extensive pneumonia, or high levels of hs-CRP or cytokines, including IL-6. The ability of APE to modulate the immune response and potentially attenuate excessive inflammation warrants further investigation and may have clinical implications in managing patients at risk for severe disease.

Conclusions
It was found that there were no beneficial or harmful effects of APE on COVID-19 patients who were receiving favipiravir treatment. Early reduction of IL-1ß by APE was found, which might help prevent progression to severe COVID-19 and has potential immunomodulatory benefits in preventing cytokine storms and need further study.
