LEGACY: Phase 2a Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamic Effects of the Anti-EL (Endothelial Lipase) Antibody MEDI5884 in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease
Introduction
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world.1,2 The key initiating event is the retention and accumulation of cholesterol-rich apoB (apolipoprotein B)-containing proteins, such as LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL-C), within the arterial intima.3 A totality of evidence from genetic studies, prospective epidemiological cohort studies, and randomized trials have demonstrated that lowering LDL-C reduces the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.4 However, even with the marked lowering of LDL-C by several pharmacological therapies, patients remain at significant risk for adverse cardiovascular events.5

To address this residual risk, there has been long-standing interest in developing therapies to increase HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol (HDL-C) because elevated HDL-C is one of the strongest epidemiological surrogates for protection against coronary heart disease.6,7 However, recent genetic studies and data from pharmacological interventional trials of niacin and CETP (cholesteryl ester transfer protein) inhibitors have demonstrated that higher HDL-C does not in itself translate into a clinical benefit.8 A possible explanation is that the number and quality of HDL particles rather than the quantity of cholesterol in the particles may be the main driver of the cardioprotective effects. Furthermore, the mechanism of how you achieve higher levels of HDL may be important.9 Recent data support the notion that cholesterol efflux capacity is positively correlated with reduced cardiovascular mortality risk.10

EL (endothelial lipase) is a circulating phospholipase A1 enzyme that hydrolyzes HDL phospholipids, resulting in increased catabolism of HDL and its loss through the kidney. Although partial and complete loss-of-function LIPG gene mutations are associated with elevated HDL-C and increased cholesterol efflux, correlation of these changes with a reduction in cardiovascular risk reduction has not been established. While some studies have suggested a benefit,11 a larger Mendelian randomization study did not demonstrate a lower risk of myocardial infarction.12 As Mendelian randomization captures biochemical changes and adaptations during development and before disease onset, they may not recapitulate the effect of interventions designed to modify biochemical processes in the context of established disease. MEDI5884, a humanized immunoglobulin G 4P kappa monoclonal antibody is a high-affinity and selective human EL-neutralizing antibody that has the potential to increase the quantity and quality of HDL by reducing hydrolysis of phospholipids thereby facilitating reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which could translate into a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.13 LEGACY was a trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic effects of multiple doses of MEDI5884 in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
LEGACY was a phase 2a, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that randomized 132 patients at 23 sites in the United States (Appendix A in the Data Supplement). The protocol and amendments were approved by the ethics committees at participating sites. The lead investigators and MedImmune (part of AstraZeneca)—the trial sponsor—were responsible for the conduct of the study. The sponsor was responsible for data collection. The raw database was provided to the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) study group, which conducted data analyses independently of the sponsor.

Trial Population
Patients were eligible for participation in the trial if they were between 45 and 80 years of age and had clinically evident coronary artery disease, defined as a history of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, coronary atherosclerosis diagnosed >3 months before screening (based on invasive or noninvasive testing), or abnormal stress testing diagnostic of coronary artery disease. Patients had to have an LDL-C =100 mg/dL on a stable dose (=28 days before screening) of high-intensity statin therapy defined as atorvastatin =40 mg or rosuvastatin =20 mg daily for non-Asian patients or =10 mg rosuvastatin daily for Asian patients. Exclusion criteria included triglycerides >500 mg/dL and any unstable cardiovascular condition within the past 3 months. Full eligibility criteria are provided in Appendix B in the Data Supplement. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Randomization and Study Agents
Patients could undergo a screening period of up to 30 days. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 3 once monthly subcutaneous doses of MEDI5884 (50, 100, 200, 350, or 500 mg) or volume-matched placebo.

End Points
The primary end point was the safety and tolerability of MEDI5884 through the end of the study (day 151), including the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment-emergent serious adverse events (AEs) through the end of the study, day 151. Secondary end points included change in HDL-C and apoB from baseline to day 91 (the trough effect 30 days after the final monthly dose), as well as pharmacokinetics and antidrug antibody (ADA) incidence and titer through day 151. Additional end points included the change on various other lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins (including total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, apoA1 [apolipoprotein A1], lipoprotein particle size, and number), cholesterol efflux from baseline to day 91, and cholesterol uptake by liver cells at day 91 (MEDI5884 350 mg versus placebo). Cholesterol efflux and uptake by liver cells was conducted by VascularStrategies LLC (Plymouth Meeting, PA).14,15

Statistical Analysis
A sample size of at least 120 patients (20 in each treatment group) provided 95% power to detect a 30% increase from baseline in HDL-C at day 91 for the comparison of each MEDI5884 treatment group versus placebo at a 2-sided alpha of 5%, assuming a common SD of 25%. It also provided >80% power to rule out 10 mg/dL increase from baseline in apoB at day 91 for the comparison of each MEDI5884 treatment group versus placebo at a 1-sided alpha of 10%, assuming a common SD of 14 mg/dL.

Safety analysis were based on the as-treated population. Specific AEs were counted once for each subject for calculating percentages. In addition, if the same AE occurred multiple times within a particular subject, the highest severity and level of relationship observed was reported. All TEAEs and treatment-emergent serious AEs were summarized overall, as well as categorized by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities System Organ Class and Preferred Term. ADA incidence rate and titer was tabulated for each treatment group. All pharmacodynamic analyses (lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, cholesterol efflux) were analyzed in the as-treated population and summarized by treatment group. Statistical comparisons of these end points between each MEDI5884 treatment group and placebo are reported as least squares mean difference using an ANCOVA adjusted by baseline value and treatment group with the last-observation-carried forward approach to handle missing data.

Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity
A validated immunoassay for the quantitative measurement of MEDI5884 in human serum was performed. Briefly, anti-idiotypic antibodies to MEDI5884 were utilized in a sandwich immunoassay format conducted on the Gyrolab Workstation. The lower limit of quantification of the assay was 0.0125 µg/mL. Pharmacokinetics observations <0.0125 µg/mL were imputed as half of lower limit of quantification (0.00625 µg/mL) for figure visualization. Pharmacokinetics data associated with missing doses were excluded from the pharmacokinetics analyses. Noncompartmental analysis was performed based on the individual concentration-time profiles for MEDI5884-treated patients using Phoenix WinNonlin (version 7.0; Certara, Princeton, NJ). Individual pharmacokinetics parameters such as Cmax, Tmax, AUC, terminal half-life (t1/2), CL/F, and drug accumulation were reported and summarized by the treatment group.

Formation of ADA against MEDI5884 has the potential to affect the safety, pharmacokinetics, or pharmacodynamics of MEDI5884. Therefore, ADA results were summarized, and assessments of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics were performed. ADA assessment followed a tiered approach of screening, confirmatory, and titration assays. Electrochemoluminescent assays were performed on the Meso Scale Discovery platform and utilized a bridging format whereby biotinylated and ruthenium-labeled MEDI5884 were used as capture and detection reagents, respectively, in a semihomogenous assay. Samples that were above the statistically determined cut point on the screening assay were progressed to the confirmatory assay that used competition with drug to confirm/reject the screening result, again based on a statistically determined cut point. Samples positive on the confirmatory assay underwent titer assessment. The minimum titer was 10 correlating with the minimum dilution of the assay. ADA negative samples were reported as <10.

Results
From December 2017 to November 2018, a total of 132 patients underwent randomization to 1 of the 5 MEDI5884 treatment groups (109 patients) or placebo (23 patients; Table I in the Data Supplement). Two patients randomized to MEDI5884 50 mg inadvertently received 100 mg and were included in 100 mg for all analyses. The baseline characteristics of the patients in the treatment groups were generally similar and are shown in Table 1. The mean of age of the patients was 66.3 years, 87.1% were men, and 43.9% of the patients had a history of myocardial infarction. All patients were taking high-intensity statin therapy, and 6.1% were also taking ezetimibe. LDL-C was well controlled in this population with a mean LDL-C of 69 mg/dL. All patients received at least 1 dose of the study drug. Premature discontinuation of study agent occurred in 8 patients (6.1%) and was evenly distributed across treatment arms (Table I in the Data Supplement).
Safety and Immunogenicity
AEs were generally well balanced between placebo and MEDI5884 (Table 2). There were few serious AEs (7 across 5 MEDI5884 dose groups and 2 in the placebo group), and none were thought to be related to study agent. Adverse cardiovascular events were uncommon, and there were no deaths. Self-reported and investigator-reported injection site reactions were all mild in severity. ADAs were uncommon; an ADA incidence rate of 4.3% in the placebo group and 4.2% to 14.3% across MEDI5884 dose groups with lower titer when observed and were not neutralizing antibodies. When present, ADA had no effect on MEDI5884 pharmacokinetics.
Pharmacokinetics
MEDI5884 exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics, as expected for therapeutic antibodies, likely due to target-mediated drug disposition; linear pharmacokinetics was observed at 350 and 500 mg through day 30 post-dosing at concentrations above 10.0 µg/mL, suggesting target saturation (Figure I in the Data Supplement). A mean t1/2 of 13.7 days and CL/F of 0.35 L/day was observed following the third dose in the 500-mg cohort. Minimal drug accumulation was observed when repeated doses of MEDI5884 were administered.

Lipid Data
The mean HDL-C at baseline across all patients was 42.8 mg/dL (SD, 11.8; Table 1). There was a significant dose-dependent increase in HDL-C with MEDI5884 compared with placebo, ranging from 5.8% ([95% CI, -10.3 to 21.9] P=0.48) with the 50 mg dose, to 37.5% ([95% CI, 21.8–53.2] P<0.0001) with the 200 mg dose, corresponding to an absolute increase of 15.7 mg/dL ([95% CI, 8.5–23.0] P<0.0001) to 51.4% ([95% CI, 35.7–67.1] P<0.0001) in the 500-mg dose group, corresponding to an absolute increase of 21.2 mg/dL ([95% CI, 14.0–28.5] P<0.0001; Figure 1 and Table 3). Likewise, a significant dose-dependent increase was also observed for apoA1 across treatment groups: up to 35.7% ([95% CI, 24.2–47.2] P<0.0001) in the 500-mg group. In terms of HDL particle number, the effect appeared to approach plateau, with increases compared with placebo of 10.1% ([95% CI, 2.8–17.4] P=0.007), 8.4% ([95% CI, 0.9–15.8] P=0.03), and 14.4% ([95% CI, 7.1–21.7] P=0.0001) with the 200-, 350-, and 500-mg doses. HDL particle size was increased up to 6.3% ([95% CI, 4.5–8.1] P<0.0001) in the 500-mg dose group (Table 3). MEDI5884 also increased functional HDL, increasing global cholesterol efflux capacity up to 26.2% ([95% CI, 14.3–38.0] P<0.0001; Figure 2). The increase was most pronounced for non-ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1)–mediated cholesterol efflux, while no relationship was observed in ABCA1-mediated efflux (Figure II in the Data Supplement). To assess the functional significance of the increase in cholesterol efflux capacity on the reverse cholesterol pathway, hepatic uptake of cholesterol, the final step in the process, was compared between MEDI5884 (350 mg) and placebo at day 91. MEDI5884 increased cholesterol uptake in liver cells relative to baseline by 13±8.3% compared with placebo -7.6±2.8% (Figure 3).
Statically significant increases in LDL-C with MEDI5884 were observed for doses up to 200 mg (13.5% [95% CI, 0.6–26.4]; P=0.04). The 350-mg dose led to a 20.0% increase ([95% CI, 7.0–33.1] P=0.003), and the 500-mg dose led to a 28.7% increase ([95% CI, 15.8–41.6] P<0.0001; Table 3). Nonsignificant increases in apoB were observed with doses up to 350 mg (Table 3); in the 500-mg dose group, apoB rose up to 13.1% ([95% CI, 0.6–25.6] P=0.04). LDL-C and apoB changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in small dense LDL-C by up to -34.3% ([95% CI, -53.6 to -15.1] P=0.0006).

Discussion
Inhibition of EL with MEDI5884 was well tolerated. Incidence of AEs was similar between treatment groups, and there were no serious AEs thought to be related to study agent. Injection site reactions were infrequent and mild, and ADAs were uncommon, low-titer, and of similar incidence between treatment groups. MEDI5884 demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in HDL-C, apoA1, and HDL particle number and size. Moreover, and importantly, this is one of the first trials to demonstrate a dose-dependent increase in functional HDL as measured by cholesterol efflux capacity.

Cholesterol efflux capacity is a measure of the ability of HDL to promote cholesterol excretion by initiating RCT.16 Cholesterol efflux has been demonstrated to be inversely associated with the incidence of cardiovascular events and a more robust predictor of risk than is HDL-C quantity.10,17 HDL-C is a marker of cholesterol load carried by HDL and does not represent the dynamic functionality of HDL particles, which may explain the failures of therapies that raise HDL-C quantity without improving HDL function.18 Although MEDI5884 increased the total macrophage efflux cholesterol efflux, there was significant heterogeneity with respect to specific cholesterol transporters, with a substantial increase in non-ABCA1–mediated efflux and no effect on ABCA1-mediated efflux. The ABCA1 transporter accounts for 30% to 40% of cholesterol efflux and is essential to the maturation of HDL from small, dense particles containing mostly apoA1 to larger spherical particles containing more cholesterol ester. In contrast, non-ABCA1 transporters, which handle the majority of cholesterol efflux, play a significant role in efflux to larger mature HDL particles.17,18 HDL metabolism is complex, and the clinical benefit of preferentially increasing cholesterol efflux through specific transporters is unknown, although both processes contribute to unloading of cholesterol from cholesterol overloaded cells. Studies of CETP inhibitors have shown varying effect on transporter-specific efflux although comparisons are difficult as assay methodologies vary considerably.19 The differential mechanism of action between the CETP and EL inhibitors may also account for important differences. Specifically, EL blockage delays HDL catabolism by blocking HDL phospholipid hydrolysis rescuing HDL loss from kidney filtration while CETP inhibitors delay HDL catabolism by blocking esterified cholesterol transfer from HDL to LDL—a process essential for delivery of cholesterol to the liver for further catabolism. Thus, although both EL blockade and CETP inhibition increase HDL and enhance the first step in RCT, cholesterol efflux, their effects on delivery of cholesterol to the liver, the ultimate step in the process likely necessary for clinical effect, are different. EL blockage increases while CETP inhibition blocks RCT. Reassuringly, we demonstrate that MEDI5884 significantly increased hepatic uptake of cholesterol compared with placebo, possibly due to enrichment of HDL phospholipids.20 As delivery of cholesterol to the liver represents the final step of the RCT, it is further supportive evidence that inhibition of EL by MEDI5884 results in an increase in functional HDL particles that are capable of facilitating the completion of the entire RCT process. Importantly, the correlation between changes in efflux and cholesterol uptake by hepatocytes and cardiovascular benefit in patients is unknown. It will be necessary to validate and translate these in vitro studies to in vivo studies in animals and humans.

In addition to the expected pharmacodynamic effects on HDL, elevations in LDL-C were observed with MEDI5884. However, the effects only achieved statistical significance in the highest MEDI5884 dose groups. Moreover, the elevations in apoB were smaller and only significant at the highest dose. This is relevant as both epidemiological and genetic data support apoB as the best predictor of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.21,22 Correspondingly, these increases in LDL-C were accompanied by a significant decrease in small dense LDL particles, which has been shown to have a greater atherogenic potential than that of other LDL subfractions and that small dense LDL particles are a better marker for prediction of cardiovascular disease than that of total LDL-C.23 The increase in LDL-C is not unexpected, as an increase in functional HDL can deliver a greater cholesterol load directly to the liver or indirectly by shifting cholesterol to LDL particles, which are taken up the liver via the LDL receptor. This is in contrast to the CETP inhibitor, which blocks the transfer of cholesterol to apoB-containing particles and interrupts LDLR (LDL receptor)–mediated cholesterol delivery back to the liver.9 Consistent with this, cotreatment of nonhuman primates with MEDI5884 and PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 serine protease) neutralizing antibody completely eliminated the LDL-C increase observed with MEDI5884 treatment alone.24 These findings suggest that the increase in LDL-C observed with anti-EL treatment is more likely due to significantly enhanced RCT and the saturation of available liver LDLRs rather than inability of these receptors to interact and remove LDL in the absence of EL activity. Our data support that EL is not essential for LDL metabolism and recognition by the LDLR. In addition, the decrease in small dense LDL particles suggests that enhanced RCT may result in a less atherogenic lipid phenotype. Additional studies are needed to define the clinical implications of the rise in LDL-C observed. In addition, there may be anti-inflammatory effects associated with inhibition of EL by MEDI5884. HDL isolated 28 days after MEDI5884 treatment in healthy patients demonstrated an enhanced ability to suppress palmitate-induced expression of both SAA3 (serum amyloid A3) and CCL2 (C-C motif chemokine ligand 2) from 3T3-L1 adipocytes relative to HDL collected before dosing.24

The totality of the dose-response data from the LEGACY trial demonstrates that the effect of MEDI5884 on measures of HDL quantity and function start to plateau at a dose of 200 to 350 mg. Doses above 200 mg appear to impact the duration of the effect more than the peak effect, with a dose of 350 mg providing a constant effect across a 30-day dosing interval. This is consistent with pharmacokinetics of MEDI5884. Importantly, the elevations in LDL-C and apoB were also only observed in the higher dose groups. These data suggest that a MEDI5884 dose of or slightly above 200 mg may be the optimal dose to carry forward for further clinical development.

Conclusions
Inhibition of EL by MEDI5884 increases the quantity of functional HDL particles in patients with stable coronary artery disease on high-intensity statin therapy without an adverse safety signal. These data support further clinical investigation to determine whether EL inhibition prevents the progression of atherosclerosis.
