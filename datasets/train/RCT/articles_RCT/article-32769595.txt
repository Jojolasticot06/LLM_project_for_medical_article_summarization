Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis is a relatively common driver of neurogenic claudication and low-back pain, particularly in the adult population, in which the prevalence of degenerative spondylolisthesis has been estimated to be approximately 3% to 8%1,2. Despite this relatively high prevalence, the medical and surgical treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis remains controversial. While surgery for symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis has been shown to provide cost-effective gains in health-related quality of life and quality-adjusted life years, nonoperative treatment options, including physical therapy and epidural steroid injection (ESI), are more common than operative treatment and are typically attempted prior to surgery3-5.
There is strong evidence of the efficacy of ESI for treatment of radicular low-back pain6. In a systematic analysis of the literature on lumbar disc herniation, MacVicar et al. found ESI to be associated with complete pain relief in up to 30% of patients, although this effect was less apparent for patients with chronic radicular pain7. A prospective trial of patients for whom lumbar discectomy was indicated showed that a high percentage avoided surgery when ESI was administered8. The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) documented worse outcomes, in both operative and nonoperative groups, for patients who underwent ESI treatment for spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis9. However, the efficacy of ESI treatment for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis remains unclear. Although recent research suggests a relationship between ESI and short-term pain relief (up to 4 months) for such patients, we are not aware of any previous investigation of long-term outcomes and rates of surgical avoidance for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis treated with ESI10,11.

Surgical treatment, with or without prior corticosteroid injection, can provide excellent clinical outcomes for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis who do not respond to nonsurgical care12. Given the cost and risks associated with ESI treatment, it is important to investigate its relationship with long-term clinical outcomes as well as the ability to avoid surgery for patients diagnosed with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Using 4-year prospective data from the degenerative spondylolisthesis cohort of the SPORT, we sought to measure the effect of ESI on both patient-reported outcomes and perioperative complications and assess the relationship between ESI treatment and rates of crossover from nonoperative to operative management. We hypothesized that long-term clinical outcomes and surgical crossover rates would not differ between patients who received ESI and those who did not.

Materials and Methods
Study Design
The methods in the SPORT have been discussed extensively in previous publications, both overall and as they relate to the degenerative spondylolisthesis study arm13-16. The SPORT was conducted at 13 medical centers across the United States, and included both a randomized patient cohort and an observational cohort of patients who declined randomization but met the same selection criteria as the randomized patients. The present study combines both the randomized and the observational cohorts for an “as treated” analysis.

Patient Population
The SPORT degenerative spondylolisthesis patient population has similarly been described in previous publications14-16. All patients were older than 18 years, had neurogenic claudication or persistent radicular leg pain for at least 12 weeks, cross-sectional imaging showing evidence of stenosis, and standing lateral radiographs showing degenerative spondylolisthesis. All patients were confirmed as surgical candidates by physicians, and all provided informed consent prior to study enrollment. Patients with adjacent stenotic levels were eligible for enrollment; patients with spondylolysis or isthmic spondylolisthesis were not. Enrollment took place from March 2000 to February 2005.

Study Interventions
Operatively treated patients underwent standard posterior decompressive laminectomy, with or without bilateral single-level fusion, as previously described13-17. Nonoperatively treated patients had at least 1 of the following: active physical therapy, counseling regarding home exercise, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if appropriate.

Study Measures
The primary measure of this study was surgical crossover, defined as a change from the assigned treatment (for the randomized cohort) or the chosen treatment (for the observational cohort). Additional study measures included patient-reported questionnaires, collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and then annually up to 4 years from baseline. Patient-reported questionnaires included the Bodily Pain, Physical Function, Mental Component Summary, and Physical Component Summary domains of the Short-Form 36 (SF-36); the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); the Stenosis Bothersomeness Index; the Low Back Pain Bothersomeness Scale; and satisfaction with current

Abstract
Background:
Although epidural steroid injection (ESI) may provide pain relief for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis in treatment regimens of up to 4 months, it remains unclear whether ESI affects crossover from nonoperative to operative management.

Methods:
This retrospective cohort study analyzed 2 groups of surgical candidates with degenerative spondylolisthesis: those who received ESI within 3 months after enrollment (ESI group) and those who did not (no-ESI group). Annual outcomes following enrollment were assessed within operative and nonoperative groups (patients who initially chose or were assigned to surgery or nonoperative treatment) by using longitudinal mixed-effect models with a random subject intercept term accounting for correlations between repeated measurements. Treatment comparisons were performed at follow-up intervals. Area-under-the-curve analysis for all time points assessed the global significance of treatment.

Results:
The study included 192 patients in the no-ESI group and 74 in the ESI group. The no-ESI group had greater baseline Short Form-36 (SF-36) Bodily Pain scores (median, 35 versus 32) and self-reported preference for surgery (38% versus 11%). There were no differences in surgical rates within 4 years after enrollment between the no-ESI and ESI groups (61% versus 62%). The surgical ESI and no-ESI groups also showed no differences in changes in patient-reported outcomes at any follow-up interval or in the 4-year average. Compared with the nonoperative ESI group, the nonoperative no-ESI group showed greater improvements in SF-36 scores for Bodily Pain (p = 0.004) and Physical Function (p = 0.005) at 4 years, Bodily Pain at 1 year (p = 0.002) and 3 years (p = 0.005), and Physical Function at 1 year (p = 0.030) and 2 years (p = 0.002). Of the patients who were initially treated nonsurgically, those who received ESI and those who did not receive ESI did not differ with regard to surgical crossover rates. The rates of crossover to nonoperative treatment by patients who initially chose or were assigned to surgery also did not differ between the ESI and no-ESI groups.

Conclusions:
There was no relationship between ESI and improved clinical outcomes over a 4-year study period for patients who chose or were assigned to receive surgery for degenerative spondylolisthesis. In the nonsurgical group, ESI was associated with inferior pain reduction through 3 years, although this was confounded by greater baseline pain. ESI showed little relationship with surgical crossover.

For the SF-36, higher scores indicate less severe symptoms; for the ODI, Stenosis Bothersomeness Index, and Low Back Pain Bothersomeness Scale, higher scores indicate inferior outcomes.

Statistical Analysis
Within the SPORT degenerative spondylolisthesis cohort, there were 2 groups of patients: those who underwent ESI within the first 3 months after enrollment (ESI group) and those who did not (no-ESI group). Patients were excluded from the analysis if they underwent ESI prior to or >3 months after enrollment in SPORT. We excluded those with delayed intervention as it may have been performed as a “salvage” intervention following failed initial nonsurgical treatment9.

Within each treatment arm (surgical and nonsurgical), baseline demographic factors and clinical factors were compared between the ESI and no-ESI groups with use of a chi-square test for categorical variables and a t test for continuous variables. Clinical outcome scores were compared between the no-ESI and ESI groups with longitudinal mixed-effect statistical modeling, adjusted for the following possible confounding variables: age; sex; work status; body mass index (BMI); any neuroforamen (left or right); hypertension; depression; osteoporosis; joint problems; current symptom duration; reflex deficit; number of moderately/severely stenotic levels; treatment preference; baseline SF-36, ODI, and Stenosis Bothersomeness Index scores; and treatment center. This modeling allowed for an estimation of treatment effect, or the difference in the mean change from baseline between the surgical and nonsurgical groups. All mixed modeling was done using a random subject intercept term to account for repeated observations over time. Patient-reported outcomes were compared between ESI groups at each annual follow-up time point and over the entire 4-year study period using Wald tests. Statistical analysis was conducted with S-PLUS software (Insightful); statistical modeling was performed with SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute). Significance was set at p < 0.05, with 2-sided hypothesis testing.

Results
Comparison of Baseline Demographic and Clinical Characteristics in ESI Groups
The present analysis included 266 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis with 4-year follow-up; 74 (27.8%) had ESI within the first 3 months after enrollment, and 192 (72.2%) did not (Fig. ​(Fig.1).1). The ESI and no-ESI groups did not differ with respect to any baseline demographic factors, including age, sex, race, education, BMI, or comorbidity status (Table I). The groups also did not differ with regard to stenosis severity (p = 0.83), baseline presence of radicular pain (no-ESI: 70% versus ESI: 74%, p = 0.62), or neurological deficits (no-ESI: 53% versus ESI: 53%, p = 0.90).
Comparison of Baseline Patient Demographics, Comorbidities, Clinical Findings, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Between the ESI and No-ESI Groups
As compared with the no-ESI group, at baseline the ESI group presented with inferior SF-36 scores for the Bodily Pain (no-ESI: 35 versus ESI: 32, p = 0.004) and Mental Component Summary (no-ESI: 54 versus ESI: 48, p = 0.014) subsections as well as higher levels of Leg Pain Bothersomeness (p = 0.042) and self-reported preference for surgery (no-ESI: 38% versus ESI: 11%, p < 0.001). Patient groups did not differ in any other baseline health status measures (Table I).

Assessment of Operative Cohort
Within the surgical cohort, there were no differences between the no-ESI and ESI groups in terms of operative details (see Appendix A), although the ESI group had higher rates of revision at 1 year (no-ESI: 7% versus ESI: 17%, p = 0.030) and 2 years (no-ESI:
11% versus ESI: 24%, p = 0.030). The surgical ESI and no-ESI groups did not differ in terms of operative time, blood loss, decompression rates, or rates of multilevel fusion.

Surgical Crossover by ESI Group
Overall, there were no differences in the rate of surgical treatment within 4 years after enrollment between the no-ESI and ESI groups (no-ESI: 61% versus ESI: 62%, p = 0.97). For patients who initially chose or were assigned to receive nonsurgical care, there was no relationship between ESI and crossover to surgical care. Similarly, for patients who initially chose or were assigned to operative treatment, there was no relationship between ESI and crossover to nonsurgical care (Table II).
Patient-Reported Outcomes by ESI Group
At an average of 4 years, the nonsurgical no-ESI group showed greater average improvement compared with the nonsurgical ESI group in terms of SF-36 Bodily Pain (no-ESI: 17.8 versus ESI: 7.8, p = 0.004) and Physical Function (no-ESI: 13.1 versus ESI: 4.3, p = 0.005) scores as well as a superior reduction in the Stenosis Bothersomeness Index (no-ESI: −4.1 versus ESI: −2.4, p = 0.041). For surgical patients, ESI treatment was not associated with superior 4-year average improvements in patient-reported outcomes (Table III). The treatment effect of surgery with respect to 4-year changes in the SF-36 Physical Function score, however, was greater for the ESI group (no-ESI: 12.7 versus ESI: 20.2, p = 0.016).
An annual breakdown comparing the change in patient-reported outcomes scores between the no-ESI and ESI groups in both the nonsurgical and the surgical cohorts is shown in Figure ​Figure22 and Appendix B. Of note, within the nonsurgical cohort, the no-ESI group showed greater improvements in the SF-36 Bodily Pain score at 1 year (no-ESI: 19.2 versus ESI: 5.0, p = 0.002) and 3 years (no-ESI: 21.5 versus ESI: 5.8, p = 0.005). These patients also showed superior improvements in the SF-36 Physical Function score at 1 year (p = 0.030) and 2 years (p = 0.002). In the surgical cohort, there were no differences between the no-ESI and ESI groups in any patient-reported outcome changes at any annual follow-up interval.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the longer-term impact of ESI on outcomes and conversion to surgical treatment in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Prospective outcomes data from the SPORT were used to review the impact of ESI on numerous patient-reported outcome measures, perioperative complications, and conversion to and from surgical treatment pathways. These results are particularly important in the context of the general popularity of ESI in nonoperative management of spinal disorders, the relative expense of ESI compared with other nonoperative measures, and the excellent outcomes reported after surgical treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis15,18.

This study failed to support the use of ESI in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, whether or not surgery was performed. Our results showed no statistically significant or substantial benefit in terms of patients avoiding surgery. For patients who initially underwent nonsurgical treatment, ESI was not associated with lower rates of crossover to surgical care; for patients who were initially designated to receive surgical treatment, ESI was not associated with higher rates of surgical avoidance. Likewise, analysis of short and longer-term patient-reported outcomes failed to demonstrate any benefit from ESI
in patients who underwent surgery, other than a significantly higher 4-year treatment effect in the SF-36 Physical Function score. Furthermore, the data suggested detrimental effects in terms of the SF-36 Bodily Pain and Physical Function scores and the Stenosis Bothersome Index for patients who avoided surgery.

The North American Spine Society’s Evidence-Based Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis indicated insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against ESI treatment for degenerative spondylolisthesis19. While some studies showed short-term improvements in pain following ESI for degenerative spondylolisthesis, others showed appreciable risks associated with ESI, including rates of adverse events as high as 20% and, for patients who undergo spine surgery, increased risks of infection and postoperative wound complications10,11,20-23. Regardless of the diagnosis, there is still uncertainty with respect to identifying patients likely to benefit from ESI. For example, in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial of ESI in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation and radiculitis, Manchikanti et al. found that approximately one-quarter of patients did not experience a clinically meaningful response to ESI within 2 rounds of treatment24.

While previous studies have focused on short-term outcomes of ESI for degenerative spondylolisthesis, to our knowledge our analysis is the first to investigate clinical outcomes in the longer term of 4 years. The short-term benefits of ESI in degenerative spondylolisthesis populations have previously been explored in the literature. In a cohort of 171 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, Sencan and colleagues showed ESI to be associated with successful pain relief for up to 180 days after the first round of treatment10. In a population of 33 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, Kraiwattanapong and colleagues also showed a significant relationship between ESI and improvement in visual analog scale pain scores over a 1-year study period11. In our nonsurgical group, patients with ESI actually had smaller average 4-year changes in SF-36 Bodily Pain and Physical Function scores, although this finding may be confounded by higher levels of baseline bodily pain in the ESI group. In the context of previous research, our results suggest that, while ESI treatment may provide temporary pain and disability relief for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, this clinical benefit is not maintained in the longer term. Furthermore, any relief that ESI provides to patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis probably does not impact the decision to undergo surgery, as it was not associated with rates of surgical crossover in this study.

This study combined both randomized and observational cohorts of patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis from the SPORT for an “as treated” analysis. Although this design increased our study sample size and the statistical power of our findings, it also made our analysis more susceptible to confounding factors that would have been controlled for in an analysis of purely randomized patients. The results of this study may also be confounded by selection bias stemming from the lack of randomization into the ESI and non-ESI groups as well as a lack of information about why patients elected to undergo ESI treatment. There were slight baseline differences between the ESI and no-ESI cohorts as the ESI group had slightly worse Bodily Pain, Leg Pain Bothersome Scale, and Mental Component Summary scores as well as less preference for surgery. As this study did not standardize a protocol for administration of ESI, our findings may also reflect site-specific variations in injection technique and use of fluoroscopic guidance. Despite these limitations, we believe that the 13-center study design provides our results excellent generalizability. We maintain, for example, that the site-specific variations in injection technique reflect variations in clinical practice that exist across the United States.

Conclusions
For surgical patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, there was no relationship between ESI and improved clinical outcomes over a 4-year study period. For nonsurgical patients, ESI was associated with inferior pain reduction through 4 years of follow-up, although this was confounded by higher levels of baseline pain. Within the surgical and the nonsurgical treatment groups, ESI showed little relationship with surgical or nonsurgical crossover. These results suggest that, for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, ESI treatment has limited impact on the decision to avoid surgery and The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis is a relatively common driver of neurogenic claudication and low-back pain, particularly in the adult population, in which the prevalence of degenerative spondylolisthesis has been estimated to be approximately 3% to 8%1,2. Despite this relatively high prevalence, the medical and surgical treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis remains controversial. While surgery for symptomatic degenerative spondylolisthesis has been shown to provide cost-effective gains in health-related quality of life and quality-adjusted life years, nonoperative treatment options, including physical therapy and epidural steroid injection (ESI), are more common than operative treatment and are typically attempted prior to surgery3-5.

Materials and Methods
Study Design
The methods in the SPORT have been discussed extensively in previous publications, both overall and as they relate to the degenerative spondylolisthesis study arm13-16. The SPORT was conducted at 13 medical centers across the United States, and included both a randomized patient cohort and an observational cohort of patients who declined randomization but met the same selection criteria as the randomized patients. The present study combines both the randomized and the observational cohorts for an “as treated” analysis.

Patient Population
The SPORT degenerative spondylolisthesis patient population has similarly been described in previous publications14-16. All patients were older than 18 years, had neurogenic claudication or persistent radicular leg pain for at least 12 weeks, cross-sectional imaging showing evidence of stenosis, and standing lateral radiographs showing degenerative spondylolisthesis. All patients were confirmed as surgical candidates by physicians, and all provided informed consent prior to study enrollment. Patients with adjacent stenotic levels were eligible for enrollment; patients with spondylolysis or isthmic spondylolisthesis were not. Enrollment took place from March 2000 to February 2005.

Study Interventions
Operatively treated patients underwent standard posterior decompressive laminectomy, with or without bilateral single-level fusion, as previously described13-17. Nonoperatively treated patients had at least 1 of the following: active physical therapy, counseling regarding home exercise, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if appropriate.

Study Measures
The primary measure of this study was surgical crossover, defined as a change from the assigned treatment (for the randomized cohort) or the chosen treatment (for the observational cohort). Additional study measures included patient-reported questionnaires, collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and then annually up to 4 years from baseline. Patient-reported questionnaires included the Bodily Pain, Physical Function, Mental Component Summary, and Physical Component Summary domains of the Short-Form 36 (SF-36); the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI); the Stenosis Bothersomeness Index; the Low Back Pain Bothersomeness Scale; and satisfaction with current symptoms. For the SF-36, higher scores indicate less severe symptoms; for the ODI, Stenosis Bothersomeness Index, and Low Back Pain Bothersomeness Scale, higher scores indicate inferior outcomes.

Statistical Analysis
Within the SPORT degenerative spondylolisthesis cohort, there were 2 groups of patients: those who underwent ESI within the first 3 months after enrollment (ESI group) and those who did not (no-ESI group). Patients were excluded from the analysis if they underwent ESI prior to or >3 months after enrollment in SPORT. We excluded those with delayed intervention as it may have been performed as a “salvage” intervention following failed initial nonsurgical treatment9.

Within each treatment arm (surgical and nonsurgical), baseline demographic factors and clinical factors were compared between the ESI and no-ESI groups with use of a chi-square test for categorical variables and a t test for continuous variables. Clinical outcome scores were compared between the no-ESI and ESI groups with longitudinal mixed-effect statistical modeling, adjusted for the following possible confounding variables: age; sex; work status; body mass index (BMI); any neuroforamen (left or right); hypertension; depression; osteoporosis; joint problems; current symptom duration; reflex deficit; number of moderately/severely stenotic levels; treatment preference; baseline SF-36, ODI, and Stenosis Bothersomeness Index scores; and treatment center. This modeling allowed for an estimation of treatment effect, or the difference in the mean change from baseline between the surgical and nonsurgical groups. All mixed modeling was done using a random subject intercept term to account for repeated observations over time. Patient-reported outcomes were compared between ESI groups at each annual follow-up time point and over the entire 4-year study period using Wald tests. Statistical analysis was conducted with S-PLUS software (Insightful); statistical modeling was performed with SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute). Significance was set at p < 0.05, with 2-sided hypothesis testing.

Within the surgical cohort, there were no differences between the no-ESI and ESI groups in terms of operative details (see Appendix A), although the ESI group had higher rates of revision at 1 year (no-ESI: 7% versus ESI: 17%, p = 0.030) and 2 years (no-ESI: 11% versus ESI: 24%, p = 0.030). The surgical ESI and no-ESI groups did not differ in terms of operative time, blood loss, decompression rates, or rates of multilevel fusion.

Surgical Crossover by ESI Group
Overall, there were no differences in the rate of surgical treatment within 4 years after enrollment between the no-ESI and ESI groups (no-ESI: 61% versus ESI: 62%, p = 0.97). For patients who initially chose or were assigned to receive nonsurgical care, there was no relationship between ESI and crossover to surgical care. Similarly, for patients who initially chose or were assigned to operative treatment, there was no relationship between ESI and crossover to nonsurgical care (Table II).

Patient-Reported Outcomes by ESI Group
At an average of 4 years, the nonsurgical no-ESI group showed greater average improvement compared with the nonsurgical ESI group in terms of SF-36 Bodily Pain (no-ESI: 17.8 versus ESI: 7.8, p = 0.004) and Physical Function (no-ESI: 13.1 versus ESI: 4.3, p = 0.005) scores as well as a superior reduction in the Stenosis Bothersomeness Index (no-ESI: −4.1 versus ESI: −2.4, p = 0.041). For surgical patients, ESI treatment was not associated with superior 4-year average improvements in patient-reported outcomes (Table III). The treatment effect of surgery with respect to 4-year changes in the SF-36 Physical Function score, however, was greater for the ESI group (no-ESI: 12.7 versus ESI: 20.2, p = 0.016).

Comparison of 4-Year Average Changes in Patient-Reported Outcomes Between ESI and No-ESI Groups*
An annual breakdown comparing the change in patient-reported outcomes scores between the no-ESI and ESI groups in both the nonsurgical and the surgical cohorts is shown in Figure ​Figure22 and Appendix B. Of note, within the nonsurgical cohort, the no-ESI group showed greater improvements in the SF-36 Bodily Pain score at 1 year (no-ESI: 19.2 versus ESI: 5.0, p = 0.002) and 3 years (no-ESI: 21.5 versus ESI: 5.8, p = 0.005). These patients also showed superior improvements in the SF-36 Physical Function score at 1 year (p = 0.030) and 2 years (p = 0.002). In the surgical cohort, there were no differences between the no-ESI and ESI groups in any patient-reported outcome changes at any annual follow-up interval.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the longer-term impact of ESI on outcomes and conversion to surgical treatment in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis. Prospective outcomes data from the SPORT were used to review the impact of ESI on numerous patient-reported outcome measures, perioperative complications, and conversion to and from surgical treatment pathways. These results are particularly important in the context of the general popularity of ESI in nonoperative management of spinal disorders, the relative expense of ESI compared with other nonoperative measures, and the excellent outcomes reported after surgical treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis15,18.

This study failed to support the use of ESI in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, whether or not surgery was performed. Our results showed no statistically significant or substantial benefit in terms of patients avoiding surgery. For patients who initially underwent nonsurgical treatment, ESI was not associated with lower rates of crossover to surgical care; for patients who were initially designated to receive surgical treatment, ESI was not associated with higher rates of surgical avoidance. Likewise, analysis of short and longer-term patient-reported outcomes failed to demonstrate any benefit from ESI in patients who underwent surgery, other than a significantly higher 4-year treatment effect in the SF-36 Physical Function score. Furthermore, the data suggested detrimental effects in terms of the SF-36 Bodily Pain and Physical Function scores and the Stenosis Bothersome Index for patients who avoided surgery.

The North American Spine Society’s Evidence-Based Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spondylolisthesis indicated insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against ESI treatment for degenerative spondylolisthesis19. While some studies showed short-term improvements in pain following ESI for degenerative spondylolisthesis, others showed appreciable risks associated with ESI, including rates of adverse events as high as 20% and, for patients who undergo spine surgery, increased risks of infection and postoperative wound complications10,11,20-23. Regardless of the diagnosis, there is still uncertainty with respect to identifying patients likely to benefit from ESI. For example, in a randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial of ESI in the treatment of lumbar disc herniation and radiculitis, Manchikanti et al. found that approximately one-quarter of patients did not experience a clinically meaningful response to ESI within 2 rounds of treatment24.

While previous studies have focused on short-term outcomes of ESI for degenerative spondylolisthesis, to our knowledge our analysis is the first to investigate clinical outcomes in the longer term of 4 years. The short-term benefits of ESI in degenerative spondylolisthesis populations have previously been explored in the literature. In a cohort of 171 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, Sencan and colleagues showed ESI to be associated with successful pain relief for up to 180 days after the first round of treatment10. In a population of 33 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, Kraiwattanapong and colleagues also showed a significant relationship between ESI and improvement in visual analog scale pain scores over a 1-year study period11. In our nonsurgical group, patients with ESI actually had smaller average 4-year changes in SF-36 Bodily Pain and Physical Function scores, although this finding may be confounded by higher levels of baseline bodily pain in the ESI group. In the context of previous research, our results suggest that, while ESI treatment may provide temporary pain and disability relief for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, this clinical benefit is not maintained in the longer term. Furthermore, any relief that ESI provides to patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis probably does not impact the decision to undergo surgery, as it was not associated with rates of surgical crossover in this study.

This study combined both randomized and observational cohorts of patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis from the SPORT for an “as treated” analysis. Although this design increased our study sample size and the statistical power of our findings, it also made our analysis more susceptible to confounding factors that would have been controlled for in an analysis of purely randomized patients. The results of this study may also be confounded by selection bias stemming from the lack of randomization into the ESI and non-ESI groups as well as a lack of information about why patients elected to undergo ESI treatment. There were slight baseline differences between the ESI and no-ESI cohorts as the ESI group had slightly worse Bodily Pain, Leg Pain Bothersome Scale, and Mental Component Summary scores as well as less preference for surgery. As this study did not standardize a protocol for administration of ESI, our findings may also reflect site-specific variations in injection technique and use of fluoroscopic guidance. Despite these limitations, we believe that the 13-center study design provides our results excellent generalizability. We maintain, for example, that the site-specific variations in injection technique reflect variations in clinical practice that exist across the United States.

Conclusions
For surgical patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, there was no relationship between ESI and improved clinical outcomes over a 4-year study period. For nonsurgical patients, ESI was associated with inferior pain reduction through 4 years of follow-up, although this was confounded by higher levels of baseline pain. Within the surgical and the nonsurgical treatment groups, ESI showed little relationship with surgical or nonsurgical crossover. These results suggest that, for patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, ESI treatment has limited impact on the decision to avoid surgery and may not be an effective long-term treatment option to reduce pain and disability.
