Immunogenicity and safety of concomitant administration of the sabin-strain-based inactivated poliovirus vaccine, the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine, and measles-mumps-rubella vaccine to healthy infants aged 18 months in China.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on China's healthcare system, causing a noticeable decline in vaccine coverage and a subsequent resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases [1, 2, 3, 4]. Immunization programs are intricate, requiring children to receive multiple vaccines concurrently. As new non-immunization programming vaccines (such as Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine [Hib], rabies vaccine, and influenza vaccine, are available in China, but are usually paid for out-of-pocket, as they are included in neither the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) system nor government health insurance) are introduced, the number of vaccines administered to infants continues to increase [[5]]. However, studies have indicated that the administration of multiple shots during vaccination is viewed as challenging by both healthcare providers and parents, potentially leading to delays in vaccination. Therefore, it becomes crucial to promote the use of combination vaccines and co-administration strategies. However, the production, research, and development capabilities of combined vaccines are limited, especially in developing countries, and there are still many technical bottlenecks that have not yet been overcome. Consequently, the practice of co-administering established vaccines becomes even more significant in ensuring effective immunization coverage and combined vaccination will increase compliance and thereby coverage [[6],[7]].
In some regions of the world, including China, the vaccination programs for sabin-strain-based inactivated poliovirus vaccine (sIPV), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccines were overlapped [[8],[9]]. Simultaneously administering these three vaccines offers several potential benefits. Firstly, it can alleviate the burden on healthcare systems by reducing the number of healthcare visits required for vaccination. Secondly, it minimizes discomfort in children by combining multiple injections into a single visit. Additionally, it simplifies scheduling for both healthcare providers and parents, leading to improved vaccine coverage and timely protection against these three diseases. China National Biotech Group Company Limited had developed and gained approval for the sIPV, DTaP, and MMR vaccines, with specific age recommendations for each. The sIPV was recommended for children aged 2 months and older, the DTaP for children aged 3 months to 6 years, and the MMR for children aged 8 months and older [[10]]. However, China's vaccination guidelines currently advise a 14-day interval between administering the sIPV, DTaP, and MMR vaccines. This cautious approach aimed to avoid potential misattribution of vaccine side effects and was based on the limited trial data available for co-administration.
To ensure the safety and effectiveness of co-administering these vaccines, it is crucial to conduct further research and evaluate their immunogenicity and safety. This assessment will provide valuable insights into whether co-administration leads to any increased reactogenicity rates, which could potentially impact vaccine uptake. By systematically studying the co-administration of sIPV, DTaP, and MMR vaccines, we can make informed decisions regarding their usage, which will contribute to enhancing vaccination strategies and safeguarding public health.
Methods
Study design and participants
A phase IV, randomized, non-inferiority, controlled trial was conducted in three sites in Sheyang County in Yancheng City, Jiangsu Province; Si County in Suzhou City, Anhui Province; and Jiangyou County in Mianyang City, Sichuan province in China. This study is a follow-up trial of the “Immunogenicity and safety of concomitant administration of the sIPV with the DTaP vaccine in children: a multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority, controlled trial (NCT04054882)” [[9]]. Follow-up assessments were conducted on the aforementioned children until 18 months of age, during which the basic immunization with the sIPV and DTaP vaccines was completed. Additionally, they will receive a single dose of the MMR vaccine at 8 months of age. Healthy children who meet the inclusion criteria will be included as part of the study population. The study population was divided into four groups (Figure 1): group I-simultaneous vaccination group (sIPV vaccine + DTaP vaccine + MMR vaccine): The target enrollment was healthy children at 18 months of age. At 18 months of age, prevaccination blood samples will be collected, and the children will receive simultaneous vaccinations of sIPV, DTaP, and MMR vaccines, with a dosage of 0.5 ml each. Postvaccination blood samples will be collected 30 days after the vaccinations. Group II-sIPV vaccination group (one dose of sIPV vaccine): The target enrollment was healthy children at 18 months of age. At 18 months of age, prevaccination blood samples will be collected, and the children will receive a single dose of the sIPV vaccine, with a dosage of 0.5 ml. Postvaccination blood samples will be collected 30 days after the vaccination. Group III-DTaP vaccination group (one dose of DTaP vaccine): The target enrollment was healthy children at 18 months of age. At 18 months of age, prevaccination blood samples will be collected, and the children will receive a single dose of the DTaP vaccine, with a dosage of 0.5 ml. Postvaccination blood samples will be collected 30 days after the vaccination. Group IV-MMR vaccination group (one dose of MMR vaccine): The target enrollment was healthy children at 18 months of age. At 18 months of age, prevaccination blood samples will be collected, and the children will receive a single dose of the MMR vaccine, with a dosage of 0.5 ml. Postvaccination blood samples will be collected 30 days after the vaccination. The immunogenicity purpose of this study was to demonstrate that immune responses to antigens in group I were not inferior to those in groups II, III, and IV at 1 month after vaccination. At the same time, we also assessed the safety of co-administration and the administration of each vaccine alone. Three milliliters of venous blood were collected on the day of vaccination and 30 days after vaccination, and serum antibody levels were detected.
The inclusion criteria for this study are as follows: (a) The study population who were 18 months of age or older on the day of enrollment; (b) the informed consent form must be signed and dated by the subject's legal guardian. The subject's legal guardian must be able to participate in all planned follow-up visits and comply with all study procedures (e.g. completing diary cards, attending visits); (c) the subjects should have completed the basic immunization with the sIPV vaccine, DTaP vaccine, and received one dose of MMR vaccine, but have not yet received the fourth dose of IPV vaccine, DTaP vaccine, and the second dose of MMR vaccine, (d) ≥14 days since last vaccination; (e) before entering the study, the subject's medical history and clinical examination should confirm a body temperature ≤37.0°C. The exclusion criteria included (a) a history or family history of severe chronic diseases, allergies, convulsions, epilepsy, encephalopathy, or psychosis or the receipt of nonspecific immunoglobulin therapy in the past 1 month; (b) allergy to any component of the vaccine; (c) acute fever and infectious disease, with a body temperature of >37.0°C; and (d) any other factor that the investigators believed might influence the study results.
Vaccines
The sIPV (0.5 ml/dose, lot number 202003016) was manufactured by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd., with 15, 45, and 45 D-antigen units (DU) of poliovirus types I, II, and III, respectively. The DTaP (0.5 ml/dose, lot number 20200212-1) was manufactured by Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd., with 4.0 international unit (IU), 30 IU, and 40 IU of the titer of acellular pertussis, diphtheria, and tetanus vaccine, respectively. The MMR used in the study (0.5 ml/dose, lot number 202003050) was manufactured by Shanghai Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd., and it contained ≥3.0 Logarithmic Calculation of 50% Cell Culture Infectious Dose (lgCCID50) of live measle virus, ≥4.3 lgCCID50 of live mump virus, and ≥3.0 lgCCID50 of live rubella virus. All vaccines were administered in the anterolateral thigh or deltoid muscle of the arm (each vaccine at a different location).
Randomization and masking
The participants in this study were the subjects of the original study who were followed up. In order to eliminate the influence of different vaccination schedules and the loss of follow-up of participants in the original study group, we re-randomized all the eligible participants into four groups: simultaneous vaccination group, sIPV vaccination group, DTaP vaccination group, and MMR vaccination group at a ratio of 1:1:1:1. Random number was generated by an independent statistician using block randomization by SAS 9.4 (block size: 8). An open-label trial was conducted, but the laboratory personnel did not know the sort of vaccine that each group of participants received.
Procedures
The sIPV+DTaP+MMR group received the sIPV, DTaP, and MMR vaccines and the sIPV group received sIPV, the DTaP group received DTaP, and the MMR group received MMR on day 0. Venous blood samples of 3 ml were collected before the first vaccination (day 0) and 30 days after completion of vaccination.
Immunogenicity assessment
The assessment criteria for the immunogenicity of the sIPV vaccine involve the use of a cell culture micro-neutralization assay (cytopathic effect inhibition) to measure serum antibody levels. A titer of ≥1:8 for antibodies against poliovirus types I, II, and III was considered positive. If the prevaccination antibody titer was <1:8, and the postvaccination antibody titer reaches ≥1:8, or if the prevaccination antibody titer was ≥1:8, and the postvaccination antibody titer shows at least a 4-fold increase, these two situations are considered seroconversion. The serum antibody levels were represented using the geometric mean titer (GMT). The IgG (immunoglobulin G) antibodies against pertussis toxoid (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), tetanus (TT), diphtheria (D), measles, mumps and rubella in serum were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after vaccination. Seropositive for PT and FHA antibodies were defined as a titer of ≥20 IU/ml for pertussis antibodies, and the minimum level of anti-PT and anti-FHA IgG detection was 0.1 IU/ml. Seropositive for TT and D was defined as an antibody titer of ≥0.1 IU/ml. The pertussis antibody seroconversion was defined as a titer of ≥20 IU/ml if the prevaccination antibody titer <20 IU/ml, or at least a four-fold increase if the prevaccination antibody titer of ≥20 IU/ml. The TT and D antibody seroconversions were defined as a titer of ≥0.1 IU/ml if the prevaccination antibody titer <0.1 IU/ml, or at least a four-fold increase if the prevaccination antibody titer of ≥0.1 IU/ml. The measles, mumps and rubella antibody seroconversions were defined as a titer of ≥200 mIU/ml, ≥100 IU/ml and ≥20 IU/ml if the prevaccination antibody titer <200 mIU/ml, <100 IU/ml and <20 IU/ml, respectively, or seropositivity before vaccination and at least a four-fold increase after vaccination.
Safety assessment
All participants were monitored by the study physician for 30 minutes after vaccination for adverse events (AEs). The participants’ guardians were responsible for documenting any adverse reactions occurring within 7 days following vaccination. Meanwhile, investigators collect data on adverse reactions, AEs, and serious AEs (SAEs) occurring within 30 days after vaccination via telephone interviews. The long-term safety follow-up extends up to 6 months postvaccination. Local solicited AEs included pain, redness, swelling, induration, rash, and pruritus, while systemic solicited AEs included fever, irritability, vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, drowsiness, and allergic reactions. Any AEs were classified according to guidelines issued by the State Food and Drug Administration, and the researchers investigated whether they were related to the vaccine.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the non-inferiority of the GMT between the sIPV+DTaP+MMR group and the sIPV group, DTaP group, and MMR group. The secondary outcome was the rate of AEs within 7 days, and evaluation of the safety of sIPV, DTaP, and MMR vaccine administered simultaneously.
Statistical analysis
STATA version 17 was used for statistical analysis. All safety and immunogenicity analyses were descriptive, and Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's exact tests and nonparametric tests were used to analyze the results. The GMT for each vaccine was calculated using their respective 95% CIs. The geometric means of antibodies among groups were compared using the analysis of variance after logarithmic conversion, and the difference was statistically significant if P <0.05. Non-inferiority test results were considered significant when the P-value <0.05. If the lower limit of the 95% CI of the seroconversion rate difference between groups was ≥−10%, the sIPV+DTaP+MMR group was considered to be non-inferior to the sIPV group, the DTaP group, and the MMR group. If the lower limit of 95% CI of GMTs ratio was ≥0.67, the co-administration group was non-inferior to the separate inoculation group.
Results
Baseline demographic characteristics
A total of 582 subjects were enrolled in the study, with 146 in the simultaneous vaccination group and 146, 146, and 144 subjects in the three control groups, respectively. One subject violated the protocol in group III. During the study period, 19 subjects dropped out, including six in the simultaneous vaccination group and five, seven, and one subject(s) in the three control groups, respectively. There were 44 cases of protocol deviation, including 12 in the simultaneous vaccination group and 11, 10, and 11 subjects in the three control groups, respectively. In the end, a total of 518 infants (group I: 128 subjects, group II: 130 subjects, group III: 128 subjects, group IV: 132 subjects) were included in the per-protocol population, and the baseline demographic characteristics were comparable among the study groups (Table 1 and Figure 1).
Immunogenicity
One month after receiving the booster vaccination, all children in the four groups exhibited seropositivity for all antigens, indicating an adequate serological response. The GMTs of neutralizing antibodies against poliovirus types I, II, and III on day 30 were as follows: in group I, they were 1060.22 (95% CI: 865.73-1298.39), 1537.06 (95% CI: 1324.27-1784.05), and 1539.10 (95% CI: 1296.37-1827.29), respectively. These values were lower than those in group II (1119.59 [95% CI: 914.73-1370.33], 1663.52 [95% CI: 1366.55-2025.02], and 1806.75 [95% CI: 1468.95-2222.23]) (P >0.05). However, the GMT ratios of poliovirus types I and II met the non-inferiority criteria, with values of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.71-1.26) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.72-1.18), respectively (Figure 2).
For group I and group III, the GMTs of neutralizing antibodies against diphtheria were 4.63 (95% CI: 4.14-5.18) and 4.47 (95% CI: 3.95-5.06), respectively. The GMTs of neutralizing antibodies against PT were 114.49 (95% CI: 104.88-124.99) in group I and 127.50 (95% CI: 114.12-142.45) in group III. The GMTs of neutralizing antibodies against FHA were 76.04 (95% CI: 68.68-84.18) in group I and 78.31 (95% CI: 70.00-87.60) in group III. The GMT of tetanus antibodies in group I was lower than that in group III (7.70 [95% CI: 7.15-8.29] vs 9.62 [95% CI: 8.71-10.61]) (P <0.05). However, the non-inferiority criteria were met for the GMTs of diphtheria, tetanus, PT, and FHA-neutralizing antibodies.
There were no significant differences in the GMTs of anti-Mumps and anti-Rubella antibodies between group I and group IV (P >0.05) on day 30 after booster vaccination. However, the GMT of measles-neutralizing antibodies in group I was higher than that in group IV (2011.16 [95% CI: 1874.34-2157.97] vs 2278.31 [95% CI: 2085.73-2488.67]) (P <0.05) (Table 2). The non-inferiority criteria for the lower limit of the 95% CI of differences were met for MMR (the lower limit of 95% CI of GMTs ratio was ≥0.67) (Figure 2).
Safety assessments
Within 30 days after vaccination, AEs were observed in 15 (10.3%) of 146 participants in group I, 9 (6.6%) of 146 participants in group II, 7 (4.8%) of 146 participants in group III, and 8 (5.6%) of 144 participants in group IV. There were no significant differences in AE rates among the four groups (group I vs group II, P = 0.20; group I vs group III, P = 0.076; group I vs group IV, P = 0.14). Fever and swellings were the solicited events that occurred differentially across the groups (Table 3). Among the participants, group IV had the highest number of severe (grade III) symptoms, with one (0.69%) reporting decreased appetite and two (1.4%) reporting diarrhea (Supplementary Material). No SAEs were reported during the entire duration of the clinical study, and similar results were observed for vaccine-related AEs occurring within 7 days after vaccination (Supplementary Material).
Discussion
The results of this study showed that the combination vaccination induces a non-inferior immune response when compared to individual vaccination and have similar safety profile. To prevent common infectious diseases among children, the health divisions of each country recommend that children should be vaccinated according to the vaccination schedule. Due to improvements in vaccine research and development technology, an increasing number of vaccines have been produced. In many cases, these vaccines will overlap in vaccination schedules. By administering multiple vaccines during the same visit, co-administration reduces the burden on healthcare systems, streamlines the immunization process, and minimizes logistical challenges for both healthcare providers and recipients [11, 12, 13, 14]. Our previous research showed that the immunogenicity and safety of the co-administered vaccines (sIPV and DTaP) were comparable to those of vaccines administered individually. These findings support the implementation of co-administration strategies, particularly in settings where combination vaccines are limited or unavailable. Further research is needed to investigate the immunogenicity, safety, and long-term efficacy of co-administered other vaccines. Rigorous studies should explore potential interactions, reactogenicity, and the overall effectiveness of various vaccine combinations to inform evidence-based vaccination strategies.
The incidence of AEs in the co-administration group was slightly higher compared to the separate group in our study. It is important to note that the DTaP and MMR vaccines have been extensively used in China for many years, while the sIPV vaccine from the Beijing Institute of Biological Products received marketing approval in 2017 [[15]], and was precertified by World Health Organization in 2022, and these vaccines have established safety profiles. Passive post-marketing surveillance conducted in Guangzhou, China, from 2011-2017 for the DTaP-IPV/Hib vaccination did not reveal any safety concerns, with a reported incidence of 728 AEs following immunization cases per million doses [[16]]. Similarly, the reported incidence of AEs following immunization with measles-containing vaccines in Anhui Province and Jiangsu Province, China, was 191.4 and 148.88 per million doses, respectively [[17],[18]]. The most frequently reported AEs were redness at the injection site, followed by fever, which aligns with previous studies [19, 20, 21]. The results of this study showed that the incidence of fever in the co-administration group (4.11%) was significantly higher than in the MMR group alone. The incidence of fever in the co-administration group (4.11%) was significantly higher than in the MMR group alone, likely due to the pertussis toxin, diphtheria toxoid, and aluminum content of the vaccine and T helper 2 orientation of cytokine production, which may lead to an enhanced local and systemic response [[22],[23]]. It is important to emphasize that most reported AEs were mild to moderate in nature, and no SAEs were reported throughout the clinical study period. This highlights the overall safety profile of the co-administered vaccines.
There were currently no published data on the immunogenicity and safety of co-administration of sIPV and DTaP with MMR vaccine in China. Previous studies have shown that several inactivated vaccines, one inactivated vaccine and one attenuated live vaccine can be co-administered without time interval [[12],[24]]. The rates of seropositivity and incidence of AEs were comparable to those observed when the vaccines were administered alone [[25],[26]]. Furthermore, it has been observed that co-administration can elicit higher antibody levels against certain diseases, such as diphtheria and rubella, when compared to individual vaccine administration. The immune response produced by the simultaneous and single administration groups was similar to the results of the phase III clinical trial [27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. The results of this study showed that the GMT levels of antibodies in the simultaneous administration group were non-inferior to those in the single administration group, except for antibodies of type III of sIPV. These results suggest that co-administration of the three vaccines is unlikely to affect the immunogenicity induced by each respective vaccine. It is important to acknowledge that further research is warranted to fully understand the immunogenicity and safety of co-administered sIPV, DTaP, and MMR vaccines, particularly in the context of the Chinese population. Robust studies, including randomized controlled trials and post-marketing surveillance, can provide valuable insights into the long-term immunogenicity, safety profiles, and potential interactions of these co-administered vaccines.
There are some limitations of this study, it did not provide evidence to demonstrate non-inferiority of the GMTs for type III antibodies of the IPV vaccine in the combined vaccination group compared to the separate vaccination group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the GMTs of type III antibodies between the combined vaccination group and the separate vaccination group, with GMTs of 1539.10 and 1806.75, respectively, both reaching the protective level. It is important to note that this study had certain limitations in terms of sample size, as it was an extension of the basic immunization project. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the progress of clinical trials.
In conclusion, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of co-administration sIPV, DTaP, and MMR vaccines. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, co-administration would help to mitigate administrative costs and enhance vaccine coverage rates. These results are of significant importance in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases in China and other developing countries.
