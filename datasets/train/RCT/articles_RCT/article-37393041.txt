Efficacy of combination therapy of fluvoxamine and favipiravir vs favipiravir 
monotherapy to prevent severe COVID-19 among mild to moderate COVID-19 patients: 
Open-label randomized controlled trial (EFFaCo study).

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented mortality and morbidity. The hope for preventing severe disease and death in high-risk, non-hospitalized patients through increasing evidence of effective oral antiviral agents such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and molnupiravir reduces progression to severe disease, hospitalization, or death [1, 2, 3]. Favipiravir (FPV), an RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase inhibitor, was used for outpatient COVID-19 treatment in Thailand, following Thai COVID-19 treatment guidelines during the peak of the Alpha and Delta variant outbreak [[4]]. A meta-analysis of multiple studies found that FPV treatment was safe and provided significant clinical improvement, including lower clinical deterioration, greater viral clearance, reduced supplemental oxygen therapy, and lower mortality depending on time to initial treatment [[5],[6]]. However, the well-designed study demonstrated that FPV efficacy was not preventing disease progression to severe COVID-19 and is still a treatment gap [[7]]. All antiviral agents had limited use during the viral replicating phase, and accessibility of novel agents, especially in developing countries, remains a significant challenge in over half of countries worldwide, particularly with the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Moreover, no anti-inflammatory effect inhibits cytokine storm or developing severe COVID-19.
Fluvoxamine (FVX), a non-sedating antidepressant, is a potent, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and a σ-1 receptor (S1R) agonist that expected the anti-inflammatory (cytokine reduction) and antiviral lysosomotropic activity, modulating on inositol requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) effects on autophagy, and SSRI inhibition of platelet activation [13, 14, 15, 16].
The double-blind, small, randomized controlled trial (RCT) in symptomatic non-hospitalized patients with COVID-19, STOP COVID 1 trial, showed that no patient developed clinical deterioration to severe COVID-19 in patients who received 100 mg twice daily of FVX within 7 days after onset compared with 8.7% in the placebo group [[17]]. However, a meta-analysis included the phase III study, the STOP COVID 2 trial (NCT04668950), which evaluated patients who received either 100 mg twice daily of FVX or a placebo for 15 days, which early discontinuation for futility in 547 participants due to the increasing vaccination rate leading to reducing several events, the deterioration rate was 4.8% in FVX and 5.5% in the placebo group (relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI: 0.42-1.81]) [[18]].
The large-scale double-blind RCT in the Brazilian TOGETHER trial demonstrated the 100 mg twice daily of FVX efficacy in reducing hospitalization and longer observations in emergency room (ER) settings by 11% compared with 16% hospitalization on placebo and reduced ER visits; however, the patients had lower adherence (74%) [[19]]. A recent multicenter RCT in Brazil tested the effectiveness of a combination of 100 mg of FVX taken twice a day and 800 mcg of inhaled budesonide taken twice a day for 10 days, compared to a placebo. The study found that the group receiving the FVX treatment had lower rates of ER visits lasting over 6 hours, hospitalization, and suspected complications due to COVID-19 progression within 28 days [[20]]. The real-world prospective cohort showed a benefit of FVX in reducing hospitalization and symptom recovery on day 14 compared with the control group during the mass SARS-CoV-2 outbreak [[21]].
The ACTIV-6 (NCT04885530) trial, which randomized outpatients with COVID-19 to receive FVX 50 mg twice daily or placebo for 10 days, failed to show improved time to sustained recovery [[22]]. In addition, the COVID-OUT study, which randomized overweight or obese patients to receive FVX 50 mg twice daily for 14 days, did not demonstrate a benefit in preventing hypoxemia, ER visits, hospitalizations, or deaths. However, it has been postulated that a higher FVX dose may be more effective in producing a positive effect [[23]].
The retrospective study in the severe COVID-19 fluoxetine received group had lower mortality than the usual care group; however, it still debated more remdesivir use in the fluoxetine group [[24]]. The hospitalized patients with COVID-19 demonstrated that antidepressants reduce the risk of intubation or death [[25]]. The decreased mortality effect was found in those who received the SSRI group, especially in the fluoxetine and FVX group, compared with the control (10% vs 13%) [[26]].
This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of adjunct FVX treatment in preventing deterioration in individuals with mild to moderate COVID-19 who received FPV treatment through a virtual outpatient clinic with telemedicine monitoring.
Methods
Trial design
The open-label, RCT was conducted at Chulabhorn Hospital, Thailand. The trial followed the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The Ethics Committee approved the study for Human Research, Chulabhorn Research Institute, no. 052/2564. The trial protocol was registered in the Thai clinical trials registry (TCTR) no. 20210615002.
Participants
The 327 participants who met the inclusion criteria consisted of 18-year-old and older Thai with confirmed COVID-19 through positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with one or more respiratory symptoms, including fever, runny nose, cough, myalgia, sore throat, dyspnea, chest discomfort, or chest pain within 7 days after onset of illness. The trial excluded patients who previously received anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents within 24 hours, had complete COVID-19 vaccination ≥2 weeks, had FPV or FVX allergy, had previous use of immunosuppressive agents and chemotherapy in 6 months, were taking medication that had drug interaction to FVX and FPV, severe or critical COVID-19 defined as oxygen desaturation <95, respiratory rate >30 per minute or BP <90/60 or alteration of consciousness, multiorgan failure or respiratory failure, presented pneumonia on chest computed tomography (CT) more than 50%, World Health Organization (WHO) clinical progression scale ≥5, pregnancy or breastfeeding, and who had a terminal illness, who had depression or suicidal idea, glaucoma (Figure 1, Supplementary 1).
Interventions
Of the 327 enrolled participants, 266 patients with mild COVID-19 were randomized, 132 received adjunctive oral FVX to oral FPV, and 134 received FPV alone. While 61 moderate COVID-19 were randomized, 30 patients were assigned adjunctive FVX to FPV and dexamethasone, and 31 were assigned FPV and dexamethasone. FVX 50 mg twice daily was administered in the intervention group for 10 days. Each group received 3600 mg of FPV loading dose on day 0 and 1600 mg per day of FPV from days 1-4 in mild COVID-19 and days 1-9 in moderate COVID-19. In a patient with obesity, the FPV loading dose was 4800 mg on day 0, then 2000 mg per day of FPV on days later. All patients with COVID-19 pneumonia received 6 mg per day of dexamethasone for 10 days.
Eligibility for participation was determined by conducting a remote online self-clinical assessment via electronic diary and recording home oxygenation saturation levels through an application. To monitor the participants’ symptoms and severity, well-trained nurses conducted daily telemonitoring, including telephone and video calls through the application. Clinical evaluations were conducted on days 2, 5, 14, and 28-42, while laboratory, virologic, and radiologic evaluations were evaluated at the outpatient clinic on days 5 and 14.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was efficacy in preventing the clinical deterioration of mild COVID-19 in patients who received adjunct FVX to FPV compared with FPV treatment and moderate COVID-19 who received FVX/FPV/Dex compared to FPV/Dex treatment on day 5, evaluated by the WHO clinical progression scale. The secondary outcome was the duration from the treatment to clinical deterioration, the rate of oxygen supplemental, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, death, and inflammatory biomarkers on days 2, 5, and 14. The virologic, radiologic, and cytokine were measured on days 5 and 14. The adverse effects were observed.
Sample size
The sample size for this study was determined based on a previous phase II randomized trial that evaluated the efficacy of FVX in preventing deterioration in mild and moderate COVID-19 cases. According to the trial, FVX reduced the risk of deterioration to severe COVID-19 by 8% in moderate COVID-19 and 15% in mild COVID-19 compared to placebo [[17]]. To achieve a power of 80% to detect those who did not experience deterioration to severe disease, the study aimed to enroll 246 patients with moderate COVID-19 and 50 patients with mild COVID-19. A 10% loss to follow-up was added to account for potential dropouts. The type I error was set at 0.05. The sample size calculation was designed to ensure the study had sufficient statistical power to detect significant differences between the treatment groups.
Randomization
In the open-label trial, randomization was carried out using a computer-based block of four randomizations that generated a random allocation sequence number. The randomization process assigned participants to either mild COVID-19 or moderate COVID-19 groups in a concealed manner, with the sequence number kept in a closed envelope by a statistician.
When participants met the inclusion criteria, they were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive adjunctive FVX to FPV or FPV alone. To minimize potential bias, the nurses not involved in the clinical trial enrolled participants, and pharmacists assigned interventions using sequentially numbered containers prepared in advance.
Statistical methods
The study compared the efficacy of FVX combined with FPV vs FPV alone in preventing clinical deterioration using the WHO clinical progression scale on day 5. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was used to ensure 80% power with Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney U, and chi-square tests. The per-protocol analysis also assessed clinical deterioration with Fisher's exact test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson chi-square and Fisher's exact test, while continuous data were analyzed using independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression was used to analyze the duration from treatment to clinical deterioration, and a multi-level regression model was used to compare the treated arm with the control. The response of inflammatory markers and cycle threshold (Ct) value from nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney U test after performing the Shapiro-Wilk test for normal distribution. A two-sided P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using STATA, version 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas 77845 USA).
Results
Trial participants
From June 26, 2021, to February 22, 2022, the 2110 participants who visited the COVID-19 clinic were assessed for eligibility consisting of 79 participants who declined to participate, 115 who had consented to another parallel clinical study, and 1785 who met the exclusion criteria. Of the 327 participants who were eligible for the inclusion criteria, 266 patients with mild COVID-19 were randomized, 132 received FVX/FPV, and 134 received FPV alone. While 61 moderate COVID-19 were randomized, 30 patients received FVX/FPV/Dex, and 31 received FPV/Dex. Four and 12 patients were lost to follow-up in the FPV and FPV/FVX groups, respectively, while 6 pneumonia patients in FPV/Dex were lost to follow-up (Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics
There was no difference in participant characteristics in the FVX groups vs the non-FVX group, including age, gender, a variant of concern, body mass index (BMI), duration from the onset of symptoms to treatment, comorbidities, Ct value from PCR, radiologic manifestation, and inflammatory markers (Table 1).
The B.1.617.2 variant was predominated in all groups. The mean duration from the onset of symptoms to randomization was 2 days in mild COVID-19 and 3 days in moderate COVID-19. High-risk comorbidities were 35 (26.1%) in non-FVX and 28 (21.2%) in FVX-treated groups, while in moderate COVID-19, there were 12 (38.7%) in non-FVX groups and 11 (36.7%) in FVX groups. More than 90% of treatment arms demonstrate a BMI of less than 30 kg/m2.
The most common symptoms were fever, cough, and sore throat. Evidence of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in mild COVID-19 was 16 (12%) in non-FVX and 17 (13%) in FVX groups, respectively (P = 0.798), while immunity in moderate COVID-19 was six (19.4%) in non-FVX and three (10%) in FVX group (Table 1, Supplementary 1: Table 1).
Outcomes
The primary outcome
The ITT analysis was used to assess the primary outcome and analyzed no clinical deterioration by the WHO clinical progression scale on day 5. It found no difference in non-deterioration on the 5th day in mild COVID-19 (134 [100%] in FPV vs 128 [97%] in FVX/FPV; P = 0.059) and moderate COVID-19 (26 [83.9%] in FPV/Dex vs 26 [86.7%] in FVX/FPV/Dex; P = 1.000) (Table 2).
The secondary outcome
Clinical outcome
There was no statistically significant difference observed in the improvement of the WHO clinical progression scale between the FVX-treated and non-FVX-treated groups. In mild COVID-19 cases, on day 5, 76 individuals (56.7%) in the non-FVX-treated group and 79 individuals (59.9%) in the FVX-treated group showed improvement. On day 14, 113 individuals (84.3%) in the non-FVX-treated group and 114 individuals (86.4%) in the FVX-treated group showed improvement. Similarly, in cases of moderate COVID-19, on day 5, 9 individuals (29%) in the non-FVX-treated group and 11 individuals (36.7%) in the FVX-treated group showed improvement. On day 14, 27 individuals (87.1%) in the non-FVX-treated group and 26 individuals (86.7%) in the FVX-treated group showed improvement (Table 2).
There were no differences in hospitalization among both mild and moderate COVID-19 on 14 days (P = 0.245, P = 1.000) and 28 days (P = 1.000, P = 1.000), the need for supplemental oxygen (P = 1.000, P = 1.000) in all treatment groups in both mild and moderate COVID-19. Although there was a 4 (12.9%) in non-FVX and 4 (13.3%) in FVX group needed low-flow oxygen supplemental in moderate COVID-19. The rate of intensive care admission, mechanical ventilation, and mortality was zero in all treatment groups.
The WHO clinical progression scale was equal to 2 in 58 (43.1%) in the non-FVX and 49 (37.1%) in the FVX group in the mild COVID-19 and 17 (54.8%) in non-FVX and 15 (50%) in FVX group among moderate COVID-19 on day 5.
There was no statistically significant difference observed in the non-deterioration of the WHO clinical progression scale on day 2 between the FVX-treated and non-FVX-treated groups, with all individuals in both groups showing non-deterioration. In cases of mild COVID-19, on day 5, 134 individuals (100%) in the non-FVX-treated group and 128 individuals (97%) in the FVX-treated group showed non-deterioration (P = 0.059). Similarly, in cases of moderate COVID-19, on day 2, 31 individuals (100%) in the non-FVX-treated group and 29 individuals (96.7%) in the FVX-treated group showed non-deterioration. On day 5, 26 individuals (83.9%) in the non-FVX-treated group and 26 individuals (86.7%) in the FVX-treated group showed non-deterioration (Table 3).
In mild COVID-19, multi-level model regression evaluated visual analog scale (VAS) score arm when estimated with maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) demonstrated that the FVX arm was a significant improvement of sore throat (P = 0.026, coefficient: -0.10, 95% CI [-0.19, -0.01]) and dyspnea (P = 0.011, coefficient: -0.12, 95% CI [-0.23, -0.03]) than non-FVX arm during day 2, 4, and 5. The total VAS score in non-deterioration on day 5 demonstrated that the adjunctive FVX group was 0.03 and 0.1 lower than the non-FVX group in mild COVID-19 (P = 0.517; coefficient -0.03, 95% CI [-0.13, 0.07]) and moderate COVID-19 (P = 0.478; coefficient: -0.10, 95% CI [-0.36, 0.17]) respectively (Supplementary Figure 5, 7).
Virological outcomes
The investigation demonstrated a significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 Ct value between days 0, 5, and 14 in all FVX and non-FVX arms (P <0.001). However, the non-FVX group had a more significant increase of SARS-CoV-2 Ct value than the FVX group between day 0 vs 5 (P = 0.033) and day 0 vs 14 (P = 0.003) in a mild case, but no difference was observed in moderate COVID-19 treatment between days 0, 5, and 14 (Figure 2).
Radiologic outcomes
More improvements in chest X-rays were observed in the FVX-treated group compared to the non-FVX-treated group in cases of moderate COVID-19, although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.212). Specifically, on day 5, 16.67% of individuals in the FVX-treated group showed improvement, compared to 6.90% in the non-FVX-treated group. On day 14, 41.38% of individuals in the FVX-treated group showed improvement, compared to 17.24% in the non-FVX-treated group. However, no difference in the percentage of chest CT improvement on day 5 was shown among all groups (Table 3) (Supplementary, Table 1).
Inflammatory markers
There was a significant decrease of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), presepsin, and procalcitonin between day 0 vs day 2 and day 0 vs day 5 in moderate COVID-19 on both-treated arms. Although, the hs-CRP, presepsin, and procalcitonin were significantly decreased on days 2, 5, and 14 in mild COVID-19 in both arms.
D-dimer significantly increased from baseline on day 5 and day 14 in both arms of the pneumonia group, while this effect was seen between baseline and day 14 of mild COVID-19 treated with FVX. Overall, there was no significant difference in hs-CRP, presepsin, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and ferritin changes between days 0-2, 0-5, 2-5, and 5-14 on both comparing groups (Supplementary Figure 2, 3).
Immunomodulatory effects
A significant decrease in interleukin (IL) -6, interferon-γ, vascular endothelial growth factor, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was demonstrated in all treatment arms. However, a significant decrease in tumor necrotic factor-α was observed in mild COVID-19 with or without FVX and moderate COVID-19 with FVX.
In contrast, the regulator chemokine, IL-10, increased in both arms in mild COVID-19 and moderate COVID-19 without FVX treatment. There were no significant differences in cytokine and chemokine-related cytokine storm level changes in all treatment arms between day 0 and day 5 (Supplementary Table 3, Figure 9).
Adverse events and safety
No serious adverse events were found in all treatment arms. Serum uric level increased from baseline on days 2 and 5 and decreased on day 14 in mild and moderate COVID-19. Mild COVID-19 in the non-FVX group demonstrated higher uric levels than the FVX group on day 14 (P = 0.010). However, only the FVX group had no different serum uric levels between baseline and day 14 in mild and moderate COVID-14.
The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was significantly elevated from baseline since day 2 in mild COVID-19 and day 5 in moderate COVID-19 in uncombined FVX groups; however, only mild and moderate hepatitis was found on day 2, 5 but there was 3 of FPV/Dex, and 2 of FVX/FPV/Dex in moderate COVID-19 developed severe asymptomatic hepatitis. Participants with elevated serum uric and ALT were asymptomatic and had spontaneous resolution to baseline on days 28-42 of follow-up (Supplementary Table 4, Figure 8).
Discussion
The open-label RCT on the effectiveness of combined FVX to antiviral agents in mild to moderate COVID-19 treatment did not demonstrate any additional benefits in preventing clinical deterioration during the peak of the Delta and early Omicron variant surge. The ITT analysis evaluated the efficacy of combined FVX to FPV on day 5, a critical period for cytokine storm development in patients with COVID-19, using the WHO clinical progression scale and follow-up until 28 days. The study's findings revealed no additional benefits in preventing clinical deterioration across all treatment arms, with low rates of clinical deterioration, hospitalization, oxygen supplementation, and mortality.
Our study is the first to demonstrate that previous studies have not reported novel findings [[13]]. FVX treatment could not demonstrate additional benefits in radiological improvement, reducing inflammatory markers, decreasing viral shedding, and providing immunomodulatory effects.
In contrast to our study, the systematic reviews comparing FVX with placebo have demonstrated that FVX treatment is associated with reduced hospitalization [[27]]. The TOGETHER trial is the largest trial promising efficacy of 100 mg twice daily of FVX in reducing hospitalization. The trial consisted high-risk mixed-race population, most were Brazilian, with over 40% of patients aged over 50 years and more than 50% obese patients. The recent study acknowledged that vaccination was unavailable in Brazil when the trial commenced but was more widely available as the trial progressed, which could have significantly impacted the outcomes. Moreover, a recent study had over 30% of patients exhibit symptoms for 4-7 days; in contrast to our study, which consisted of 2-3 days of symptoms in mild and moderate COVID-19, the recent studies possibly have benefited more from treatment in approaching the early cytokine storm phase [[19]]. A recent RCT in Brazil found that 100 mg of FVX twice daily and inhaled budesonide for 10 days lowered the composite COVID-19 progression endpoint within 28 days. The trial included a high-risk mixed-race population, 40% obese, and over 90% receiving more than two doses of COVID-19 vaccine. However, FVX treatment was administered 3 days after symptom onset, earlier than in other studies [[20]].
In contrast to previous studies, our research included a population with an average age of 35 and 45 years old for mild and moderate COVID-19, respectively. Furthermore, 90% of our patients had a BMI of less than 30 kg/m2, and approximately 30% of comorbidity was presented, respectively. It is reasonable to imply that the combined FVX to FPV was administered earlier in the course of illness in middle-aged, non-obese Asians compared to recent studies. However, it is essential to note that in our trial, the dose of FVX was 50 mg twice daily, less than the dosage used in recent studies that exhibited positive outcomes [[17],[18]].
However, our study was the same as ACTIV-6 (NCT04885530), conducted on 1288 non-hospitalized adults who randomly received an equivalent dose of FVX 50 mg twice daily vs placebo for 10 days. The ACTIV-6 trial failed to demonstrate the benefit of FVX in improving time to sustained recovery, defined as 3 consecutive days without symptoms in mild to moderate COVID-19 during the Delta and Omicron variant surge. The median time to recovery in the FVX group was 12 days. Although there were differences between our study and ACTIV-6, most of the latter participants were White, and 36% obese. However, it is worth noting that the ACTIV-16 trial included more than 60% fully vaccinated patients, which may have highly affected the results [[22]]. The COVID-OUT study also showed negative results of 50 mg FVX twice daily in preventing severe COVID-19. The study included almost all White participants, 46% of whom were overweight or obese, and 45% started treatment within 4 days of symptom onset, regardless of their vaccination status [[23]]. Additionally, a small Korean study reported negative effects of FVX compared to placebo, even though the onset of illness was only 1 day. Less than 20% of pneumonia patients experienced a 7% deterioration in the FVX and placebo groups [[28]].
It is still controversial, and the tendency of 100 mg twice daily of FVX in mild to moderate COVID-19 contributed to reducing severe COVID-19 outcomes, while 50 mg twice daily does not. The true benefit of a higher FVX dose for S1R activation and the effect of body weight on FVX distribution in the respiratory tract epithelium require further study.
Despite the tolerability and safety demonstrated in FVX treatment, several unique considerations exist. These include potential interactions with certain foods and drugs, QTc prolongation when used concurrently with other medications, limited use in non-pediatric patients, and mental health decompensation when switching from a serotoninergic antidepressant in psychiatric patients.
There were several limitations in our study. First, the inclusion criteria were conducted in the early-developed symptoms within 4 days, which may have resulted in less severe cases being included in the study. Second, the study consisted of low high-risk comorbidities during the peak of the Delta variant outbreak, which a higher rate of younger infection and higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 3.31 [2.05-5.34]) than those who aged older than 50 years (HR 2.09 [1.88-2.34]) [[29]]. Third, despite excluding participants who completed the fully inactivated vaccine or ChAdOx-1 nCoV-19 vaccination for more than 2 weeks, 10-20% of immunity-detected participants might affect the outcome. Fourth, the study investigated combined outpatient with remote monitoring from telehealth, including via telephone and Face to Face video call, which might modify the clinical outcome of those who were borderline to develop a severe disease that might be a potential bias risk. Fifth, the co-administration of FPV, recommended by the Thai national guideline, might affect the outcome despite the controversy of FPV efficacy, while many recent studies demonstrate no benefit of FPV in preventing disease progression. Sixth, the lack of a placebo control in an open-label trial without blinding may impact the interpretability of outcomes, particularly when co-administered with multiple drugs. Although the study concludes that adding 50 mg of FVX twice daily did not provide any benefits, the unclear outcomes due to the non-blinded trial may affect the overall understanding of the results. Seventh, the study evaluated depression of the patients that might affect the outcome, however, only in FVX/FPV/Dex had none to moderate risk of depression, while in the other arms, none to the mild risk of depression was detected.
Conclusion
An RCT found that FVX did not have an add-on benefit in preventing deterioration in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. There was no significant difference in hospitalization rates, oxygen supplementation, or mortality. The comprehensive study demonstrated no benefit to improving the radiological, virological, inflammatory marker changes or immunomodulatory outcomes.
