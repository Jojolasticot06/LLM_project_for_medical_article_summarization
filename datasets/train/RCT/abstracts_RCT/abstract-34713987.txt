1/ PB2452, a neutralizing monoclonal antibody fragment that binds the antiplatelet 
drug ticagrelor with high affinity, is being developed as a ticagrelor reversal 
agent. 
2/ To identify a clinically useful intravenous (i.v.) reversal regimen, a 
semimechanistic exposure-response model was developed during the PB2452 
first-in-human phase I study. From a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, single-dose trial to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and 
pharmacokinetics (PKs) of PB2452 in 61 healthy volunteers pretreated with 
ticagrelor, sequential dose cohort data were used to build and refine an 
exposure-response model that combined population PK models for ticagrelor 
(TICA), ticagrelor active metabolite (TAM), and PB2452, and related their 
binding relationships to the PK of uncomplexed TICA and TAM which is predictive 
of platelet inhibition. Platelet function was assessed by multiple assays. The 
model was developed using Bayesian methods in NONMEM. Human PK and 
pharmacodynamic data from sequential dose cohorts were used to initially define 
and then refine model parameters. 
3/ Model simulations indicated that an initial 
i.v. bolus of PB2452, followed by a high-rate infusion, and then a slower-rate 
infusion would provide immediate and sustained reversal of the antiplatelet 
effects of ticagrelor. Based on model predictions, a 6 g i.v. bolus followed by 
6 g infused over 4 h and then 6 g over 12 h was identified and tested in study 
subjects and shown to provide complete reversal within 5 min of infusion onset 
that was sustained for 20-24 h. 
4/ The model is predictive of the reversal profile 
of PB2452 and will inform future trials of PB2452.
