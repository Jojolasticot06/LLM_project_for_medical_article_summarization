Preventing Chronic Disease PCD logo A Randomized Trial to Improve Adherence to Follow-upEye Examinations Among People With Glaucoma

1/Introduction
Appointment nonadherence is common among people with glaucoma, making it difficult for eye care providers to monitorglaucoma progression. Our objective was to determine whether the use of patient navigators, in conjunction with socialworker support, could increase adherence to recommended follow-up eye appointments.

2/Methods

A randomized, controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of an intervention that used patient navigators and social workersto improve patient adherence to follow-up eye care compared with usual care. Participants with glaucoma and other eyediseases (N = 344) were identified at primary care clinics in community settings through telemedicine screening of imagingand then randomized to enhanced intervention (EI) or usual care (UC). Data on participants’ visits with local ophthalmologistswere collected for up to 3 years from randomization. Groups were compared for timely attendance at the first visit with thelocal ophthalmologist and adherence to recommended follow-up visits.

3/Results
Timely attendance at the first visit was higher for EI than UC (74.4% vs 39.0%; average relative risk [aRR] = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.51–2.28; P < .001). Rates of adherence to recommended annual follow-up during year 1 were 18.6% in the EI group and 8.1% inthe usual care group (aRR = 2.08; 95% CI, 1.14–3.76; P = .02). The aRR across years 2 and 3 was 3.92 (95% CI, 1.24–12.43; P =.02).

4/Conclusion
An intervention using patient navigators and social workers doubled the rate of adherence to annual recommended follow-upeye care compared with usual care in community settings, and was effective at increasing connections with localophthalmologists. Interventions to further improve long-term adherence are needed.
