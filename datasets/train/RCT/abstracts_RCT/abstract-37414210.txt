Prostration and the prognosis of death in African children with severe malaria.

1/OBJECTIVES: Malaria is still one of the main reasons for hospitalization in 
children living in sub-Saharan Africa. Rapid risk stratification at admission is 
essential for optimal medical care and improved prognosis. Whereas coma, deep 
breathing, and, to a lesser degree, severe anemia are established predictors of 
malaria-related death, the value of assessing prostration for risk 
stratification is less certain.

2/METHODS: Here we used a retrospective multi-center analysis comprising over 
33,000 hospitalized children from four large studies, including two 
observational studies from the Severe Malaria in African Children network, a 
randomized controlled treatment study, and the phase-3-clinical RTS,S-malaria 
vaccine trial, to evaluate known risk factors of mortality and with a specific 
emphasis on the role of prostration.

3/RESULTS: Despite comparable age profiles of the participants, we found 
significant inter- and intra-study variation in the incidence of fatal malaria 
as well as in the derived risk ratios associated with the four risk factors: 
coma, deep breathing, anemia, and prostration. Despite pronounced variations, 
prostration was significantly associated with an increased risk of mortality (P 
<0.001) and its consideration resulted in improved predictive performance, both 
in a multivariate model and a univariate model based on the Lambaréné Organ 
Dysfunction Score.

4/CONCLUSION: Prostration is an important clinical criterion to determine severe 
pediatric malaria with possible fatal outcomes.
