Efficacy of combination therapy of fluvoxamine and favipiravir vs favipiravir 
monotherapy to prevent severe COVID-19 among mild to moderate COVID-19 patients: 
Open-label randomized controlled trial (EFFaCo study).

1/OBJECTIVES: Fluvoxamine (FVX) is an antidepressant proposed to its 
immunomodulatory effects in preventing deterioration in mild and moderate 
COVID-19.

2/METHODS: An open-label, 1:1 randomized controlled trial was assigned either 
combination therapy 50 mg twice daily of FVX for 10 days and favipiravir (FPV) 
or FPV alone to assess the efficacy in preventing disease progression in mild to 
moderate COVID-19 on the 5th day.

3/RESULTS: In total, 134 patients with mild COVID-19 received FPV and 132 received 
FVX/FPV, 31 patients with moderate COVID-19 received FPV/dexamethasone 
(FPV/Dex), and 30 received FVX/FPV/Dex. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis 
showed no difference of no clinical deterioration on the 5th day in both mild 
COVID-19 (100% in FPV vs 97% in FVX/FPV) and moderate COVID-19 (83.9% in FPV/Dex 
vs 86.7% in FVX/FPV/Dex). However, there was a low rate of oxygen supplemental, 
hospitalization, or intensive care in both groups and zero death in all groups. 
No significant difference in oxygen supplemental, hospitalization, radiological, 
virological, or biochemical outcomes, and the immunomodulatory effect was 
observed between the group.

4/CONCLUSION: The combined fluvoxamine treatment did not add benefit in preventing 
deterioration in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 without the 
immunomodulatory effect observed, although it demonstrated low hospitalization 
rates, oxygen supplemental, intensive care needed, and zero mortality.
