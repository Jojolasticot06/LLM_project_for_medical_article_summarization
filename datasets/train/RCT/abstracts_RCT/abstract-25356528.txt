A methylene blue-assisted technique for harvesting lymph nodes after radical 
surgery for gastric cancer: a prospective, randomized, controlled study.

1/Harvesting lymph nodes (LNs) after gastrectomy is essential for accurate 
staging. 

2/This trial evaluated the efficiency and quality of a conventional method and a methylene blue-assisted method in a randomized manner. The key eligibility criteria were as follows: (i) histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the stomach; (ii) clinical stage I-III; (iii) R0 resection planned by gastrectomy with D1+ or D2 lymphadenectomy. The primary endpoint was the ratio 
of the pathologic number of harvested LNs per time (minutes) as an efficacy measure. The secondary endpoint was the number of harvested LNs, as a quality measure. Between August 2012 and December 2012, 60 patients were assigned to undergo treatment using the conventional method (n=29) and the methylene blue dye method (n=31). The baseline demographics were mostly well balanced between 
the 2 groups. The number of harvested LNs (mean±SD) was 33.6±11.9 in the conventional arm and 43.4±13.9 in the methylene blue arm (P=0.005). The ratio of the number of the harvested LNs per time was 1.12±0.46 LNs/min in the conventional arm and 1.49±0.59 LNs/min in the methylene blue arm (P=0.010). 

3/In 
the subgroup analyses, the quality and efficacy were both superior for the methylene blue dye method compared with the conventional method. 

4/The methylene blue technique is recommended for harvesting LNs during gastric cancer surgery 
on the basis of both the quality and efficacy.
