1/ Bedaquiline (BDQ) has shown great value in the treatment of multidrug-resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in recent years. However, exposure-safety relationships 
must be explored to extend the use of BDQ. Two reported safety findings for BDQ 
are prolongation of the QTc interval and elevation of transaminase levels. 
2/ In this study, we investigated the potential relationships between BDQ and/or its 
main metabolite (M2) pharmacokinetic (PK) metrics and QTcF interval or 
transaminase levels in patients with MDR-TB using the approved dose regimen. 
Data from 429Â patients with MDR-TB from two phase IIb studies were analyzed via 
nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Individual model-predicted concentrations and 
summary PK metrics were evaluated, respectively, in the QTcF interval and 
transaminase level exposure-response models. Investigation of further covariate 
effects was performed in both models. 
3/ M2 concentrations were found to be responsible for the drug-related QTcF increase in a model accounting for 
circadian rhythm patterns, time on study, effect of concomitant medication with 
QT liability, and patient demographics. Simulations with the final model 
suggested that doses higher than the approved dose (leading to increased M2 
concentrations) are not expected to lead to a critical QTcF interval increase. 
No exposure-safety relationship could be described with transaminase levels 
despite previous reports of higher levels in patients treated with BDQ. 
4/ The developed longitudinal models characterized the role of M2 concentrations in QTc 
interval prolongation and found no concentration dependency for transaminase 
level elevation, together suggesting that BDQ exposure at the high end of the 
observed range may not be associated with a higher risk of safety events.
