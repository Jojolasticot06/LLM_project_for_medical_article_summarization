INTRAVITREAL NESVACUMAB (ANTIANGIOPOIETIN 2) PLUS AFLIBERCEPT IN DIABETIC 
MACULAR EDEMA: Phase 2 RUBY Randomized Trial.

1/PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare intravitreal nesvacumab 
(anti-angiopoietin 2) plus aflibercept with intravitreal aflibercept injection 
(IAI) in diabetic macular edema.
2/METHODS: The eyes (n = 302) were randomized (1:2:3) to nesvacumab 3 mg + 
aflibercept 2 mg (LD combo), nesvacumab 6 mg + aflibercept 2 mg (HD combo), or 
IAI 2 mg at baseline, Weeks 4 and 8. LD combo continued every 8 weeks (q8w). HD 
combo was rerandomized at Week 12 to q8w or every 12 weeks (q12w); IAI to q8w, 
q12w, or HD combo q8w through Week 32.
3/RESULTS: Week 12 best-corrected visual acuity gains for LD and HD combo versus 
IAI were 6.8, 8.5, and 8.8 letters; Week 36 changes were similar. Central 
subfield retinal thickness reductions at Week 12 were -169.4, -184.0, and -174.6 
µm (nominal P = 0.0183, HD combo vs. IAI); Week 36 reductions for LD combo and 
HD combo q8w and q12w versus IAI were -210.4, -223.4, and -193.7 versus -61.9 µm 
(nominal P < 0.05). At Week 12, 13.3% and 21.3% versus 15.2% had ≥2-step 
Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Scale improvement (LD and HD combos vs. IAI) and 
59.6% and 66.3% versus 53.7% had complete foveal center fluid resolution. Safety 
was comparable across groups.
4/CONCLUSION: Nesvacumab + aflibercept demonstrated no additional visual benefit 
over IAI. Anatomic improvements with HD combo may warrant further investigation.
