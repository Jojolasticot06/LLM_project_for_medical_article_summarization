Effectiveness of Tonsillectomy vs Modified Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in Patients With Tonsillar Hypertrophy and Obstructive Sleep Apnea: The TEAMUP Randomized Clinical Trial.

1/IMPORTANCE: Modified uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (mUPPP) is a surgical treatment for selected adults with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Tonsillectomy (TE) alone is a less extensive alternative treatment.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether mUPPP is more effective than TE alone in treating adult patients with tonsillar hypertrophy and moderate to severe OSA.
2/DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This blinded randomized clinical trial compared the effectiveness of mUPPP with TE alone before surgery and 6 months postsurgery in adults with tonsillar hypertrophy (sizes 2, 3, or 4 according to the Friedman staging) and moderate to severe OSA in a university hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Participants underwent surgery from January 2016 to February 
2021; the last postsurgery follow-up was completed in September 2021. Data analyses were performed from January to September 2022.
INTERVENTIONS: mUPPP vs TE alone.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Between-group differences on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS).
3/RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 93 patients (mean [SD] age, 41.6 [9.4] years; 80 [86%] men; race/ethnicity were not considered) with a mean (SD) body mass index of 29.0 (2.8), calculated as weight in kg divided by height in m2. Of these, 90 participants (97%) completed the protocol (mUPPP, n = 45; TE, n = 45). The mean (SD) AHI score (number of events per hour [events/h]) for the mUPPP 
group decreased by 43%, from 51.0 (22.6) to 28.0 (20.0) events/h; and for the TE group, 56%, from 56.9 (25.1) to 24.7 (22.6) events/h. The mean between-group difference in AHI score was 9.2 events/h (95% CI, 0.5 to 17.9), with a small effect size (Cohen d = 0.44) in favor of TE. For ESS scores, the between-group difference was also small, only 1.1 (95% CI, -1.3 to 3.4; Cohen d = 0.21). Neither difference was considered to be clinically relevant.
4/CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial demonstrated that mUPPP was not more effective than TE alone in treating patients with tonsillar hypertrophy and moderate to severe OSA. However, there was a small difference in favor of TE. Because TE alone is less extensive, it could be considered as an alternative to mUPPP in this selected group of patients with OSA.
