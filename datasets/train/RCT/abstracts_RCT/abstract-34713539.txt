Long-term inflammatory rosacea management with subantibiotic dose oral doxycycline 40 mg modified-release capsules once daily.

1/An important goal of effective rosacea treatment is to maximize the duration of remission. 

2/This was a two-part study. Part 1 was a multicenter, open-label, 12-week study in which adults with moderate or severe inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) of rosacea received subantibiotic dose oral doxycycline 40 mg modified release (SDD40 ) and topical metronidazole gel 1%. Part 2 was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 40-week study in which successfully treated subjects received once-daily SDD40 or placebo capsules. The primary objective was to assess relapse and efficacy during 
long-term use of SDD40 versus placebo. Relapse was defined as a return to baseline investigator global assessment (IGA) or lesion count, or any other necessary change in treatment. Part 1 enrolled 235 subjects. Sixty-five subjects in the SDD40 treatment group and 65 subjects in the placebo group met the definition of treatment success at week 12, and were included in the Part 2 analysis. At the end of Part 2, half as many subjects in the SDD40 group had relapsed compared to the placebo group (13.8% [n = 9] vs. 27.7% [n = 18], 
p < 0.05). 

3/Significant differences in the median change in inflammatory lesion counts were also observed (p < 0.05). Adverse events (AEs) were generally mild-moderate in severity, and most were not treatment-related. Stinging/burning responded with more improvement in subjects treated with SDD40 . 

4/After 52 weeks of once-daily treatment, subantibiotic dose doxycycline significantly reduced the relapse rate and inflammatory lesion counts in subjects with moderate-to-severe inflammatory rosacea.
