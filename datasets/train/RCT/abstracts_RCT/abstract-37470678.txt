Introduction: This study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and 
preliminary efficacy of tailored music listening intervention on sleep 
disturbances in older adults with dementia and their caregivers. 
Methods: We 
randomly assigned 33 older adults with dementia (mean age 71.7 [SD: 7.1], 72.7% 
female, 81.8% African American/Black) and their caregivers (mean age 58.4 [SD: 
16.7], 72.7% female, 84.8% African American/Black) to a wait-list control or 
intervention group (NCT04157244). 
Results: The music intervention was feasible 
as evidenced by high study measure completion and retention rates (>90%). 
Recruitment was stopped prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found mixed 
acceptability results from the survey and qualitative interviews with the 
participants. Both groups improved on objective sleep outcomes of sleep latency 
and wake sleep after onset. We found a small effect size for sleep duration 
post-intervention. 
Discussion: The findings provide preliminary evidence for the 
feasibility of a tailored music intervention and identified ways to improve its 
acceptability.
