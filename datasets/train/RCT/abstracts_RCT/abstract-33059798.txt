Health Promotion Programs and Policies in the Workplace: An Exploratory Study With Alaska Businesses

1/Introduction
We examined health insurance benefits, workplace policies, and health promotion programs in small to midsize businesses inAlaska whose workforces were at least 20% Alaska Native. Participating businesses were enrolled in a randomized trial toimprove health promotion efforts.

2/Methods
Twenty-six Alaska businesses completed from January 2009 through October 2010 a 30-item survey on health benefits,policies, and programs in the workplace. We generated frequency statistics to describe overall insurance coverage, and todetail insurance coverage, company policies, and workplace programs in 3 domains: tobacco use, physical activity andnutrition, and disease screening and management.

3/Results
Businesses varied in the number of employees (mean, 250; median, 121; range, 41–1,200). Most businesses offered at leastpartial health insurance for full-time employees and their dependents. Businesses completely banned tobacco in theworkplace, and insurance coverage for tobacco cessation was limited. Eighteen had onsite food vendors, yet fewer than 6businesses offered healthy food options, and even fewer offered them at competitive prices. Cancer screening and treatmentwere the health benefits most commonly covered by insurance.

4/Conclusion

Although insurance coverage and workplace policies for chronic disease screening and management were widely available,significant opportunities remain for Alaska businesses to collaborate with federal, state, and community organizations onhealth promotion efforts to reduce the risk of chronic illness among their employees.
