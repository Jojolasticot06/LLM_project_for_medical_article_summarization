1/Background: STARDOM2 is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial evaluating
 the efficacy and safety of co-crystal of tramadol-celecoxib (CTC)—a firstin-
class analgesic co-crystal comprising racemic tramadol hydrochloride and 
celecoxib in a supramolecular network that modifies their pharmacokinetic 
properties—for the management of acute postoperative pain (NCT03062644; 
EudraCT:2016–000593-38). 

2/Methods: Patients with moderate-to-severe pain following abdominal hysterectomy
 were randomized 2:2:2:2:2:1 to oral CTC 100 mg (rac-tramadol hydrochloride 
44 mg/celecoxib 56 mg) twice daily (BID); CTC 150 mg (66/84 mg) BID; CTC 200 mg 
(88/112 mg) BID; immediate-release tramadol 100 mg four times daily (QID); 
celecoxib 100 mg BID; or placebo, for 5 days. The primary endpoint was the sum 
of pain intensity differences over 0–4 h (SPID0–4). Key secondary endpoints were 
rescue medication use within 4 h, 50% response rate at 4 h, and safety/tolerability. 

3/Results: Of 1355 patients enrolled, 1138 were randomized (full analysis set) 
and 1136 treated (safety analysis set). In the prespecified gatekeeping analysis 
of SPID0–4, CTC 200 mg was not superior to tramadol but showed non-inferior 
efficacy (p <0.001) that was sustained throughout the 120-h period, despite a 
5-day cumulative tramadol administration of 880 mg with CTC 200 mg BID versus
 2000 mg with tramadol 100 mg QID. Treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) and severe TEAEs were less common with CTC 200 mg versus tramadol. 
Treatment-related TEAEs were 14.4% with CTC 200 mg and 23.6% with tramadol. 

4/Conclusions: Although the study did not meet its primary endpoint, CTC 200 mg 
showed a clinically relevant improvement in overall benefit/risk profile versus 
tramadol alone, with considerably lower cumulative opioid exposure.
