Drain Versus No Drain in Open Mesh Repair for Incisional Hernia, Results of a 
Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.

1/BACKGROUND: Open mesh repair of incisional hernia is associated with different 
local complications, particularly bleeding and seroma formation. Traditionally, 
drains have been placed perioperatively to prevent these complications, despite 
the lack of scientific evidence or expert consensus. We formulated the 
hypothesis that the absence of drainage would reduce number of patients 
presenting collections or complications. The present study aimed to compare 
postoperative complication rates after open mesh repair for incisional hernia 
with or without prophylactic wound drainage.

2/METHODS: Prospective randomized study using standardized surgical technique and 
drain placement. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of residual fluid 
collection with ultrasound on postoperative day 30. Other complications, 
subdivided into medical and surgical, were analyzed as secondary endpoints.

3/RESULTS: There were 144 patients randomized (70 with drain, 74 without drain). 
No difference was identified between both groups for fluid collection at 30 days 
(60.3% vs. 62%, p = 0.844). However, less surgical complications were identified 
in the drain group (21.7% vs. 42.7%, p = 0.007), with a lower wound dehiscence 
rate (1.5% vs. 9.3%, p = 0.041).

4/CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic drainage in open incisional hernia repair does not 
objectively reduce the rate of postoperative fluid collections. Therefore, our 
results do not support the use of routine drainage in incisional hernia repair.
