Anti-obesity effect of Neoagaro-oligosaccharides with overweight and obese subjects: a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial

1/Background This trial aimed to evaluate the anti-obesity effects and safety of Neoagaro-oligosaccharides (NAOs) in 
humans in a 16 week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

2/Methods One hundred overweight or obese subjects with a body mass index of 23 to 34.9 kg/m2 and a percent 
body fat of > 25% for males or > 30% for females were enrolled. NAOs or placebo products were administered at 3 g 
(twice a day, four capsules once) each for 16 weeks. Efficacy and safety biomarkers were measured before and after 
intervention.

3/Results After 16 weeks of intervention, the group administered with NAOs had statistically significant decreases in 
visceral fat area and visceral-subcutaneous fat area ratio compared to the placebo group. The NAOs group suppressed 
the increase in weight and BMI compared to the placebo group, which was significant between groups. High-density 
lipoprotein- cholesterol was increased in the group administered with NAOs, which showed a significant trend 
compared to the placebo group. Clinical changes were not observed for any safety biomarkers.

4/Conclusions These results suggest that NAOs have a beneficial effect on obesity. Thus, NAOs could be used as an anti-obesity supplement without side effects.
