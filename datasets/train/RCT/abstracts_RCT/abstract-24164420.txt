Preemptive treatment of Cytomegalovirus infection in kidney transplant 
recipients with letermovir: results of a Phase 2a study.

1/Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a significant cause of morbidity and 
mortality in transplant recipients. Letermovir (AIC246), is a novel anti-HCMV 
drug in development, acting via a novel mechanism of action. 

2/In this proof-of-concept trial with first administration of letermovir to patients, 27 transplant recipients with active CMV replication were randomly assigned to a 14-day oral treatment regimen of either letermovir 40 mg twice a day, letermovir 80 mg once a day, or local standard of care (SOC) in a multicenter, open-label trial. Efficacy, safety, and limited pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed. 

3/All groups had a statistically significant decrease in CMV-DNA copy number from 
baseline (40 mg BID: P = 0.031; 80 mg QD: P = 0.018; SOC: P = 0.001), and 
comparison of viral load reduction between treatment groups showed no 
statistically significant differences. Viral clearance was achieved for 6 of 12 
patients (50%) in the letermovir groups versus two of seven SOC patients 
(28.6%). Letermovir treatment was generally well tolerated, no patient developed 
CMV disease during the trial. Both letermovir treatment regimens resulted in 
equally high trough level plasma concentrations. 

4/The efficacy, safety, and 
pharmacokinetics observed in these viremic transplant recipients indicate that 
letermovir is a promising new anti-CMV drug.
