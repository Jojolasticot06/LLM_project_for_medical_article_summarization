SURGICAL OUTCOMES OF VITREOMACULAR TRACTION TREATED WITH FOVEAL-SPARING PEELING OF THE INTERNAL LIMITING MEMBRANE

1/Purpose: To compare sensitivity of the retina after complete internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling versus foveal-sparing ILM peeling in vitrectomy for vitreomacular traction syndrome.

2/Methods: This was a randomized, prospective, comparative study. Thirty-four eyes were randomized to undergo peeling with foveal sparing of the ILM (FS group) or complete peeling group. Foveal and perifoveal retinal sensitivity, visual acuity, and central macular thickness were the main outcome measures.

3/Results: Parafoveal retinal sensitivity exhibited a significant improvement in both the FS and complete peeling groups (+2.43 ± 0.82 dB and +1.79 ± 0.86 dB, respectively; P = 0.037). Significant improvements were observed in both visual acuity and central macular thickness in both groups. No cases of epiretinal membrane recurrence were observed in the FS group.

4/Conclusion: Both the FS and complete peeling surgical techniques are safe and yielded good anatomical and functional results; however, a significant difference in favor of FS was found in relation to the best-corrected visual acuity and perifoveal retinal sensitivity. Preservation of the foveal ILM disc allowed the anatomical restoration of the foveal architecture in most vitreomacular traction syndrome cases without signs of stiffening or ILM fibrosis over a follow-up period of 1 year.
