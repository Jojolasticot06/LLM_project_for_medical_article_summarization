The impact of the Safe Delivery Application on knowledge and skills managing 
postpartum haemorrhage in a low resource setting: a cluster randomized 
controlled trial in West Wollega region, Ethiopia.

1/BACKGROUND: Postpartum haemorrhage is one of the leading causes of maternal 
mortality in low-income countries. Improving health workers' competencies in 
obstetric emergencies in low-income settings, has been recognized as an 
important factor in preventing maternal mortality and morbidity. mHealth 
interventions in maternal and newborn health care has shown the potential to 
improve health service delivery. Strong study designs such as randomized 
controlled trials are missing to estimate the effectiveness of the mHealth 
interventions.

2/METHODS: Between August 2013 and August 2014, 70 health facilities in West 
Wollega Region, Ethiopia were included and randomized to intervention or control 
in a cluster randomized controlled trial. At intervention facilities birth 
attendants were provided with a smartphone with the SDA installed. Of 176 
midwives and "health extension workers," 130 completed at 12 months follow-up. 
At baseline and after 6- and 12-months participants were assessed. Knowledge was 
tested by a Key Feature Questionnaire, skills by an Objective Structured 
Assessment of Technical Skills in a structured role-play scenario.

3/RESULTS: Baseline skills scores were low and comparable with a median of 12/100 
in the intervention and the control group. After 6 months skills had doubled in 
the intervention group (adjusted mean difference 29.6; 95% CI 24.2-35.1 compared 
to 1·8; 95% CI - 2.7 to 6.3 in the control group). At 12 months skills had 
further improved in the intervention group (adjusted mean difference 13.3; 95% 
CI 8.3-18.3 compared to 3.1; 95% CI - 1.0 to 7.3 in the control group). 
Knowledge scores also significantly improved in the intervention group compared 
to the control (adjusted mean difference after 12 months 8.5; 95% CI 2.0-15.0).

4/CONCLUSION: The Safe Delivery App more than doubled clinical skills for managing 
postpartum haemorrhage among birth attendants making it an attractive tool to 
reduce maternal mortality.
