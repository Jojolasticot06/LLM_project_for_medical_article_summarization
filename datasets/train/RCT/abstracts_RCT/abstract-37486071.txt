BACKGROUND: Only two-thirds of patients admitted to psychiatric wards return to 
their previous jobs. Return-to-work interventions in Germany are investigated 
for their effectiveness, but information regarding cost-effectiveness is 
lacking. This study investigates the cost-utility of a return-to-work 
intervention for patients with mental disorders compared to treatment as usual 
(TAU).
METHODS: We used data from a cluster-randomised controlled trial including 166 
patients from 28 inpatient psychiatric wards providing data at 6- and 12-month 
follow-ups. Health and social care service use was measured with the Client 
Sociodemographic and Service Receipt Inventory. Quality of life was measured 
with the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Cost-utility analysis was performed by 
calculating additional costs per one additional QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life 
Years) gained by receiving the support of return-to-work experts, in comparison 
to TAU.
RESULTS: No significant cost or QALY difference between the intervention and 
control groups has been detected. The return-to-work intervention cannot be 
identified as cost-effective in comparison to TAU.
CONCLUSIONS: The employment of return-to-work experts could not reach the 
threshold of providing good value for money. TAU, therefore, seems to be 
sufficient support for the target group.
