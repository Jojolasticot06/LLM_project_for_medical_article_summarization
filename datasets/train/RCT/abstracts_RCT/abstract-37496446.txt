BACKGROUND: Recovery in mental health care comprises more than symptomatic 
improvement, but preliminary evidence suggests that only collaborative care may 
improve functioning of depressed older adults. This study therefore evaluates 
the effectiveness of behavioural activation (BA) on functional limitations in 
depressed older adults in primary care.
METHODS: This study uses data from a multicentre cluster randomised controlled 
trial in which 59 primary care centres (PCCs) were randomised to BA and 
treatment as usual (TAU), and 161 consenting older (≥65 years) adults with 
clinically relevant symptoms of depression participated. Interventions were an 
eight-week individual BA programme by a mental health nurse (MHN) and 
unrestricted TAU. The outcome was self-reported functional limitations (WHODAS 
2.0) at post-treatment (9 weeks) and at 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: At the end of treatment, the BA participants reported significantly 
fewer functional limitations than TAU participants (WHODAS 2.0 difference -3.62, 
p = 0.01, between-group effect size = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.09-0.69). This medium 
effect size decreases during follow-up resulting in a small and non-significant 
effect at the 12-month follow-up (WHODAS 2.0 difference = -2.22, p = 0.14, 
between-group effect size = 0.24; 95% CI = -0.08-0.56). MoCA score moderated 
these results, indicating that the between-group differences were merely driven 
by those with no cognitive impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to TAU, BA leads to a faster improvement of functional 
limitations in depressed older adults with no signs of cognitive decline. 
Replication of these findings in confirmatory research is needed.
