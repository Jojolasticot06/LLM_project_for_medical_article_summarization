Standardised Competency-Based Training of Medical Doctors and Associate 
Clinicians in Inguinal Repair with Mesh in Sierra Leone.

1/INTRODUCTION: In low-income settings, there is a high unmet need for hernia 
surgery, and most procedures are performed with tissue repair techniques. In 
preparation for a randomized clinical trial, medical doctors and associate 
clinicians received a short-course competency-based training on inguinal hernia 
repair with mesh under local anaesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
feasibility, safety and effectiveness of the training.

2/METHODS: All trainees received a one-day theoretical module on mesh hernia 
repair under local anaesthesia followed by hands-on training. Performance was 
assessed using the American College of Surgeon's Groin Hernia Operative 
Performance Rating System. Patients were followed up two weeks and one year 
after surgery. Outcomes of the patients operated on during the training trial 
were compared to the 229 trial patients operated on after the training.

3/RESULTS: During three surgical camps, seven medical doctors and six associate 
clinicians were trained. In total, 129 patients were operated on as part of the 
training. Of the 13 trainees, 11 reached proficiency. Patients in the training 
group had more wound infections after two weeks (8.5% versus 3.1%; p = 0.041). 
There was no difference in recurrence and mortality after one year, and none of 
the deaths were attributed to the surgery.

4/DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Mesh repair is the international standard for 
inguinal hernia repair worldwide. Nevertheless, this is not widely accessible in 
low-income settings. This study has demonstrated that short-course intensive 
hands-on training of MDs and ACs in mesh hernia repair is effective and safe.
