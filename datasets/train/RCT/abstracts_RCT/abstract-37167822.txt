A combination of Tropaeolum majus herb and Armoracia rusticana root for the treatment of acute bronchitis

1/Background: Tropaeolum majus herb (nasturtium) and Armoracia rusticana root (horseradish) produce three different isothiocyanates as secondary metabolites, which exert antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulatory functions in humans.
Purpose: Combined in the medicinal product ANGOCIN® Anti-Infekt N, the two natural components demonstrated promising effects against acute bronchitis.

2/Study design: A randomized, two-armed, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IV study revealed the healing fostering effect of the two herbal plant components METHODS: This study included 384 patients, with 195 in the treatment and 189 in the placebo group. The 'bronchitis severity score' (BSS) was utilized as primary endpoint. This score sums the ratings for five significant bronchitis symptoms, which are established at the patient's visits to the clinic.

3/Results: Compared to placebo intake, the group of patients treated with the phytomedicine showed statistically significant accelerated healing of bronchitis symptoms after three days of treatment, with reductions in coughing, mucous production, and chest pain. This beneficial effect persisted for the entire duration of treatment until day ten.

4/Conclusion: In conclusion, a combination of Tropaeolum majus herb and Armoracia rusticana root promotes an elevated improvement of bronchitis symptomatology.
