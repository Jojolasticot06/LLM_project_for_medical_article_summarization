Vitamin D supplementation to prevent tuberculosis infection in South African 
schoolchildren: multicenter phase 3 double-blind randomized placebo-controlled 
trial (ViDiKids).

1/OBJECTIVES: To determine whether weekly oral supplementation with 10,000 IU 
vitamin D3 for 3 years reduces the risk of sensitization to M. tuberculosis in 
South African schoolchildren aged 6-11 years with negative 
QuantiFERON-tuberculosis (TB) Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) assay results at baseline.

2/METHODS: We conducted a phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trial in 1682 
children attending 23 primary schools in Cape Town. The primary outcome was a 
positive end-trial QFT-Plus result, analyzed using a mixed effects logistic 
regression model with the school of attendance included as a random effect.

3/RESULTS: 829 vs. 853 QFT-Plus-negative children were randomized to receive 
vitamin D3 vs. placebo, respectively. Mean end-study 25(OH)D concentrations in 
participants randomized to vitamin D vs. placebo were 104.3 vs 64.7 nmol/l, 
respectively (95% confidence interval for difference, 37.6 to 41.9 nmol/l). A 
total of 76/667 (11.4%) participants allocated to vitamin D vs. 89/687 (13.0%) 
participants allocated to placebo tested QFT-Plus positive at 3-year follow-up 
(adjusted odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.62-1.19, P = 0.35).

4/CONCLUSION: Weekly oral supplementation with 10,000 IU vitamin D3 for 3 years 
elevated serum 25(OH)D concentrations among QFT-Plus-negative Cape Town 
schoolchildren but did not reduce their risk of QFT-Plus conversion.
