Modified-release nicotinamide for the treatment of hyperphosphataemia in 
haemodialysis patients: 52-week efficacy and safety results of the phase 3 
randomized controlled NOPHOS trial.

1/BACKGROUND: We previously reported that modified-release nicotinamide (NAMR) was 
superior to placebo in reducing serum phosphate concentrations over 12 weeks in 
a large cohort of haemodialysis patients with hyperphosphataemia. Here we report 
outcomes after 52 weeks of treatment.

2/METHODS: NOPHOS was a phase 3, international, randomized, controlled, 
double-blind trial with a parallel group design. NAMR (250-1500 mg/day) was 
investigated in comparison to placebo as an add-on therapy to an individual 
therapy with approved phosphate binders.

3/RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat population (NAMR: n = 539; placebo: n = 183), 
serum phosphate was significantly lower in the NAMR group compared with the 
placebo group at week 24 (5.40 ± 1.55 versus 5.79 ± 1.37 mg/dl, P < .001) with a 
mean difference of -0.39 mg/dl [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.66 to -0.13], 
but was comparable between the groups at week 52 [mean difference -0.08 (95% CI 
-0.36-0.20)]. In the completer population (n = 358), statistical significance in 
favour of NAMR was reached at weeks 24 and 52. The treatment effect was reduced 
in patients with high baseline serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) compared 
with patients with low baseline serum iPTH. Compliant patients in the NAMR group 
had a more pronounced and sustained reduction in serum phosphate than 
non-compliant patients. NAMR treatment was associated with a significantly 
increased risk of thrombocytopenia, pruritus, anaemia, and diarrhoea. Herpes 
zoster occurred exclusively in patients randomized to NAMR.

4/CONCLUSIONS: NAMR combined with phosphate binders significantly reduced serum 
phosphate over the first 24 weeks of treatment, but the treatment effect was not 
maintained up to week 52. Non-compliance may have contributed to reduced 
long-term efficacy. Several newly identified safety signals warrant further 
evaluation.
