BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a self-reported experience of 
declining cognitive function showing normal performance in cognitive 
assessments, which is a known risk factor for dementia. Recent studies highlight 
the importance of nonpharmacological multidomain interventions that can target 
multiple risk factors of dementia in older adults.
OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy of the Silvia program, a 
mobile-based multidomain intervention, to improve cognitive function and 
health-related outcomes of older adults with SCD. We compare its effects to a 
conventional paper-based multidomain program on various health indicators 
related to risk factors of dementia.
METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial involved 77 older adults 
with SCD recruited from the Dementia Prevention and Management Center in 
Gwangju, South Korea during May to October 2022. Participants were randomly 
assigned to either the mobile- or paper-based group. Interventions were 
administered for 12 weeks, where pre- and post-assessments were conducted.
RESULTS: The K-RBANS total score did not show significant differences between 
groups. The mobile group showed better improvement in K-PRMQ scores and PSS 
scores than the paper group. Differences within groups showed that mobile-based 
interventions significantly improved K-PRMQ, STAI-X-1, PSS, and EQ-5D-5 L 
scores, while paper-based interventions significantly improved PSS, and 
EQ-5D-5 L scores. Patient adherence rate was 76.6%.
CONCLUSION: Overall, the Silvia program was effective for improving 
self-reported memory failures, stress, anxiety, and health-related quality of 
life in older adults with SCD. However, longer periods of administration for 
more than 12 weeks may be needed to achieve significant improvements in 
cognitive function by objective measures.
