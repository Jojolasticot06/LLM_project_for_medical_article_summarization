An accessible, relational, inclusive, and actionable (ARIA) model of genetic 
counseling compared with usual care: Results of a randomized controlled trial.

1/PURPOSE: Effective approaches to communicate genomic information are needed to 
ensure equitable care. In a randomized controlled superiority trial, we tested a 
novel practice model that aims to make genetic counseling inclusive, by making 
the communication accessible, relational, and actionable (ARIA).

2/METHODS: In total, 696 English- and Spanish-speaking patients aged 18 to 49 
years, enriched for individuals from historically underserved backgrounds, were 
randomized in 1:1 ratio to ARIA or usual care. Primary outcomes were accuracy of 
recall, communication satisfaction, and perceived understanding. In total, 33 
participants completed qualitative interviews.

3/RESULTS: Recall and understanding were high for all participants. ARIA 
participants scored higher on the relationship scale of communication 
satisfaction (mean difference = 0.09, 95% CI = <0.01 to 0.17). Moderator 
analyses of communication satisfaction showed that those with lower health 
literacy reported less communication difficulty in ARIA and those using medical 
interpreters reported greater communication ease in ARIA. No significant 
difference was found on other primary and secondary outcomes. Qualitative data 
enhanced understanding of how and why ARIA can be effective.

4/CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that a genetic counseling intervention 
that focuses on specific communication skills to enhance relationship-building, 
patient engagement, and comprehension can be effective with all patients and may 
be especially valuable for patients of lower health literacy and 
Spanish-speakers who use a medical interpreter.
