A daily regimen of a ceramide-dominant moisturizing cream and cleanser restores the skin permeability barrier in adults with moderate eczema: A randomized trial.

1/The dysfunctional skin barrier in eczema patients may be attributed to decreased levels of ceramides in the stratum corneum. 

2/The aim of this study was to 
determine whether a two-part system consisting of a ceramide-dominant physiological lipid-based moisturizing cream and cleanser could ameliorate the signs and symptoms of moderate eczema in adults over 28 days compared to placebo. 

3/Assessments were conducted at baseline and every 7 days thereafter. Eczema area severity index score decreased significantly across all time points in both groups compared to baseline (P < .0001), however, this decrease was not significant between groups at day 28 (P = .7804). In contrast, transepidermal water loss and skin hydration significantly improved over time in the active group, while it either stayed the same or worsened in the placebo group (P = .0342 and P < .0001, respectively). There was no difference in the use of mometasone furoate as rescue medication over time between groups (P = .1579). Dermatology life quality index scores improved significantly in both groups (P < .0001), with no difference between groups (P = .5256). However, patient satisfaction was greater in the active compared to the placebo group for several parameters including relief of itch, dry skin, skin softness and smoothness (all P < .05). No patients withdrew from the study due to adverse events (AEs) and there were no serious AEs. 

4/The ceramide-dominant moisturizing cream and cleanser safely restores skin permeability and improves the signs and symptoms of eczema in adults.
