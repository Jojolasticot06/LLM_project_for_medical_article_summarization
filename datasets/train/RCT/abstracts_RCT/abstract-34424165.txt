Geographically Targeted Interventions versus Mass Drug Administration to Control 
Taenia solium Cysticercosis, Peru.

1/Optimal control strategies for Taenia solium taeniasis and cysticercosis have 
not been determined. 

2/We conducted a 2-year cluster randomized trial in Peru by 
assigning 23 villages to 1 of 3 geographically targeted intervention approaches. 
For ring screening (RS), participants living near pigs with cysticercosis were 
screened for taeniasis; identified cases were treated with niclosamide. In ring 
treatment (RT), participants living near pigs with cysticercosis received 
presumptive treatment with niclosamide. In mass treatment (MT), participants 
received niclosamide treatment every 6 months regardless of location. In each 
approach, half the villages received targeted or mass oxfendazole for pigs (6 
total study arms). 

3/We noted significant reductions in seroincidence among pigs 
in all approaches (67.1% decrease in RS, 69.3% in RT, 64.7% in MT; p<0.001), 
despite a smaller proportion of population treated by targeted approaches (RS 
1.4%, RT 19.3%, MT 88.5%). 

4/Our findings suggest multiple approaches can achieve 
rapid control of T. solium transmission.
