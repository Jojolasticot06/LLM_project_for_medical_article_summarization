BACKGROUND: Individuals who receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant 
(allo-HCT) are immunocompromised and at high risk of pneumococcal infections, 
especially in the months following transplant. This study evaluated the safety 
and immunogenicity of V114 (VAXNEUVANCE; Merck, Sharp & Dohme LLC, a subsidiary 
of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA), a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PCV), when given to allo-HCT recipients.
METHODS: Participants received 3 doses of V114 or PCV13 (Prevnar 13; Wyeth LLC) 
in 1-month intervals starting 3-6 months after allo-HCT. Twelve months after 
HCT, participants received either PNEUMOVAX 23 or a fourth dose of PCV (if they 
experienced chronic graft vs host disease). Safety was evaluated as the 
proportion of participants with adverse events (AEs). Immunogenicity was 
evaluated by measuring serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) geometric mean 
concentrations (GMCs) and opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) geometric mean titers 
(GMTs) for all V114 serotypes in each vaccination group.
RESULTS: A total of 274 participants were enrolled and vaccinated in the study. 
The proportions of participants with AEs and serious AEs were generally 
comparable between intervention groups, and the majority of AEs in both groups 
were of short duration and mild-to-moderate intensity. For both IgG GMCs and OPA 
GMTs, V114 was generally comparable to PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes, and 
higher for serotypes 22F and 33F at day 90.
CONCLUSIONS: V114 was well tolerated in allo-HCT recipients, with a generally 
comparable safety profile to PCV13. V114 induced comparable immune responses to 
PCV13 for the 13 shared serotypes, and was higher for V114 serotypes 22F and 
33F. Study results support the use of V114 in allo-HCT recipients.
