External fixation versus volar locking plate for displaced intra-articular distal radius fractures: a prospective randomized comparative study of the functional outcomes.

1/BACKGROUND: The objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of external fixation and volar plating on the functional parameter of displaced intra-articular (Cooney's type IV) distal end radius fractures using the Green and O'Brien scoring system.

2/MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective randomized study comprised 68 patients treated with external fixation and 42 patients treated with volar locking plates. The patients were followed up at 6 months and 1 year after surgery. The assessment of pain, range of motion, grip strength and activity were assessed at each follow-up visit and scored according to the Green and O'Brien scoring 
system.

3/RESULTS: At 1 year after surgery, we observed that external fixation showed significantly better results than volar locking plates using the Green and O'Brien scores for range of motion (22.0 ± 4.77 vs 19.89 ± 5.05), grip strength (19.91 ± 5.4 vs 16.89 ± 4.4) and final outcome (87.36 ± 11.62 vs 81.55 ± 11.32). No difference was found in pain and activity between these two groups of patients. Patients aged <50 years treated with external fixation showed excellent results (final score (91.57 ± 9.01) at 1 year follow-up.

4/CONCLUSION: External fixation showed superiority over volar locked plating after 1 year of surgery.
