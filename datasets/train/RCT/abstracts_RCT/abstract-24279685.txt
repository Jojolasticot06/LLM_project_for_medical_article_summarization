A randomized, controlled trial of everolimus-based dual immunosuppression versus 
standard of care in de novo kidney transplant recipients.

1/Kidney transplant recipients receiving calcineurin inhibitor-based 
immunosuppression incur increased long-term risks of cancer and kidney fibrosis. 
Switch to mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors may reduce these 
risks. 
Steroid or Cyclosporin Removal After Transplant using Everolimus 
(SOCRATES), a 36-month, prospective, multinational, open-label, randomized 
controlled trial for de novo kidney transplant recipients, assessed whether 
everolimus switch could enable elimination of mycophenolate plus either steroids 
or CNI without compromising efficacy. 

2/Patients received cyclosporin, 
mycophenolate and steroids for the first 14 days then everolimus with 
mycophenolate and CNIwithdrawal (CNI-WD); everolimus with mycophenolate and 
steroid withdrawal (steroid-WD); or cyclosporin, mycophenolate and steroids 
(control). 126 patients were randomized. The steroid WD arm was terminated 
prematurely because of excess discontinuations. 

3/Mean eGFR at month 12 for CNI-WD versus control was 65.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 67.1 ml/min/1.73 m2 by ITT, which met predefined noninferiority criteria (P=0.026). The CNI-WD group experienced a higher rate of BPAR(31% vs. control 13%, P=0.048) and showed a trend towards higher composite treatment failure (BPAR, graft loss, death, loss to follow-up). 

4/The 12 month results from SOCRATES show noninferiority in eGFR, but a significant excess of acute rejection when everolimus was commenced at week 2 to enable a progressive withdrawal of mycophenolate and cyclosporin in kidney 
transplant recipients.
