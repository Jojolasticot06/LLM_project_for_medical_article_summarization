Local budesonide therapy in the management of persistent hyposmia in suspected 
non-severe COVID-19 patients: Results of a randomized controlled trial.

1/OBJECTIVES: Consequences of COVID-19 on olfactory functions remained unclear 
during the pandemic. We assessed the efficacy of local budesonide in addition to 
olfactory rehabilitation when managing non-severe COVID-19 patients with 
persistent hyposmia.

2/METHODS: A multicentric, randomized, superiority trial was conducted 
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04361474). The experimental group (EG) received 
budesonide and physiological saline nasal irrigations administered via three 
syringes of 20 ml in each nasal cavity in the morning and evening for 30 days. 
The control group (CG) received a similar protocol without budesonide. Patients 
were included if they were >18 years old, with a SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
presenting an isolated hyposmia persisting 30 days after symptom onset. The 
primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with improvement of more than 
two points on the ODORATEST score after 30 days of treatment.

3/RESULTS: In total, 123 patients were included and randomized (EG: 62 vs CG: 61). 
Two patients from the EG met the primary endpoint with no statistical difference 
between the two groups (P = 0.5).

4/CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating local 
budesonide for COVID-19 related hyposmia treatment even though previous trials 
were performed with other local corticosteroids. Local budesonide efficacy was 
not demonstrated for persistent hyposmia related to COVID-19.
