Efficacy and safety of a topical moisturizer containing linoleic acid and ceramide for mild-to-moderate psoriasis vulgaris: A multicenter randomized controlled trial.

1/Psoriasis is a chronic, recurrent skin disease requiring long-term management. Agents that repair the skin's barrier function are invaluable additives in topical treatments of psoriasis. 

2/This multicenter, randomized, controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of a linoleic acid-ceramide-containing moisturizer (LA-Cer) for mild-to-moderate psoriasis vulgaris. We randomized 178 patients from both northern and southern regions of China into two groups: 81 patients in the control group received mometasone furoate (MF, 0.1%) cream, while MF in combination with LA-Cer was administered to 86 patients in the treatment group for 4â€‰weeks. The LA-Cer-MF group maintained the use of moisturizer after topical glucocorticoid administration. 

3/The primary endpoint, 
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 50 (PASI 50) response, revealed the superiority of LA-Cer-MF with lower relapse rates at week 8. The use of the LA-Cer-containing moisturizer as maintenance therapy resulted in a continuous improvement in the clinical state in terms of body surface area, PASI, investigators' assessment of skin dryness and desquamation, and Physician Global Assessment of Psoriasis score, and in the patients' quality of life. 

4/Thus, the LA-Cer-containing moisturizer is a promising agent to prevent and treat 
psoriasis as it enhances the therapeutic effect induced by topical glucocorticoids and delays relapse.
