BACKGROUND: The current investigation assessed a) the performance of the FOCUS 
ADHD mobile health application (App) in increasing pharmacological treatment 
adherence and improving patients' knowledge of attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD) and b) the impact of implementing a financial incentive for 
using the App (i.e., a discount on medication).
METHODS: In a randomized, blind, parallel-group clinical trial, 73 adults 
diagnosed with ADHD were allocated into three groups for 3 months: a) 
Pharmacological treatment as usual (TAU); b) TAU and the App (App Group); and c) 
TAU and the App + a commercial discount on the purchase of medication prescribed 
for ADHD treatment (App + Discount Group).
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in mean treatment adherence between 
groups, assessed as a medication possession ratio (MPR). However, the 
App + Discount Group exhibited greater medication intake registrations compared 
with the App Group during the initial phase of the trial. The financial discount 
also produced a 100% App adoption rate. App use did not increase ADHD knowledge, 
though knowledge scores were high at baseline. The usability and quality of the 
App were rated favorably.
CONCLUSIONS: The FOCUS ADHD App achieved a high adoption rate and positive 
evaluations by users. Use of the App did not increase adherence to treatment as 
measured by MPR, but, for App users, the addition of a financial incentive to 
use the App produced an increase in treatment adherence in terms of medication 
intake registrations. The present results offer encouraging data for combining 
incentives with mobile digital health solutions to positively impact treatment 
adherence in ADHD.
