The acceptability and effectiveness of a questionnaire for the identification of 
risk factors for HIV and hepatitis B and C: An observational study in general 
practice.

1/BACKGROUND: Many people in Europe remain undiagnosed for human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV).
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate acceptability and effectiveness of a questionnaire 
designed to facilitate identification of risk factors for these viruses.

2/METHODS: We performed an observational study, in a prospectively enrolled cohort 
of patients in Paris (France) seen in 2014. Eighteen GPs administered a 
questionnaire to the first 50 patients, collecting information about risk 
factors. GPs were randomized into two groups: A (self-administered 
questionnaire) and B (GP-administered questionnaire). We used the overall 
response rate to assess the acceptability of the questionnaire. We used the rate 
of newly identified risk factors and compared the number of tests performed one 
year before and immediately after the intervention to assess the effectiveness 
of the questionnaire.

3/RESULTS: 842 patients were randomized: 349 (41.5%) in group A and 493 (58.5%) in 
group B. Acceptability was 88.5% (95%CI: 86.3-90.6); 93.1% (95%CI: 90.5-95.8) 
in-group A and 85.2% (95%CI: 82.1-88.3) in group B (P = 0.0004). Prevalence of 
risk factors was 51.8% (95%CI: 48.2-54.4) and 58.3% were newly identified 
(95%CI: 52.9-63.7). The number of HIV tests performed during the four weeks 
after intervention increased by 27% compared to the same period one year before 
(P = 0.22). It increased by 113% (P = 0.005) and 135% (P = 0.005) for HBV and 
HCV, respectively.

4/CONCLUSION: The questionnaire proved acceptable and effective in identifying 
risk factors for HIV, HBV and HCV in general practice.
