Cognitive science theory-driven pharmacology elucidates the neurobiological basis of perception-motor integration

1/An efficient integration of sensory and motor processes is crucial to goal-directed behavior. Despite this high relevance, and although cognitive theories provide clear conceptual frameworks, the neurobiological basis of these processes remains insufficiently understood. 
2/In a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled pharmacological study, we examine the relevance of catecholamines for perception-motor integration processes. Using EEG data, we perform an in-depth analysis of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms, focusing on sensorimotor integration processes during response inhibition. 
3/We show that the catecholaminergic system affects sensorimotor integration during response inhibition by modulating the stability of the representational content. Importantly, catecholamine levels do not affect the stability of all aspects of information processing during sensorimotor integration, but rather-as suggested by cognitive theory-of specific codes in the neurophysiological signal. Particularly fronto-parietal cortical regions are associated with the identified mechanisms. 4/The study shows how cognitive science theory-driven pharmacology can shed light on the neurobiological basis of perception-motor integration and how catecholamines affect specific information codes relevant to cognitive control.
