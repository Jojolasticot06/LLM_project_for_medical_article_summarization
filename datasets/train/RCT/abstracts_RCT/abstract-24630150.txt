MRI and venographic aspects of pelvic venous insufficiency.

1/Pelvic venous insufficiency is a frequent pathology in multiparous women.
 
2/Diagnosis can be made by chance or suspected in the case of symptoms suggesting pelvic congestion syndrome or atypical lower limb varicosity fed by pelvic leaks. After ultrasound confirmation, dynamic venography is the reference pretherapeutic imaging technique, searching for pelvic varicosity and possible leaks to the lower limbs. 

3/MRI is less invasive and allows a three-dimensional study of the varicosity and, with dynamic angiography, it can assess ovarian reflux. 

4/It also helps to plan or even sometimes avoid diagnostic venography.
