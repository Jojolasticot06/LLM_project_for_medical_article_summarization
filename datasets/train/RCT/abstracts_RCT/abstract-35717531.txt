Randomized trial of the effect of video training on residents' surgical skills in facial skin reconstructive surgery: A SQUIRE study.

1/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of facial skin reconstruction training videos for head and neck and maxillofacial surgery residents.
2/MATERIAL AND METHODS: This randomized trial, conducted in France, involved residents in head and neck and maxillofacial surgery. A website was created containing facial skin reconstruction training videos. Selected residents performed facial skin flap dissections in the Paris School of Surgery. They were randomized into two groups, one receiving a standard course before the dissection, and the other a standard course plus a video of the flap ("no-video" and "video" groups). Each resident performed 4 facial flaps and was graded (blindly) during dissection. The main study endpoint was intergroup difference in grading score (out of 15). The article was written up following the SQUIRE-EDU (Standards for QUality Improvement Reporting Excellence in EDUcation) criteria.
3/RESULTS: Eighteen residents were included. For the main endpoint, scores were significantly higher in the "video" than the "no-video" group (6 [IQR, 4: 9] vs. 10 [9: 12]; P<0.001). In addition, as secondary endpoint, "no-video" group residents requested more assistance (3 [2: 4] vs. 1 [1: 2] P<0.001). Power was lacking for any subgroup analysis according to year of residency or to the 4 
flaps.
4/CONCLUSION: Videos improved surgical residents' performance during dissections. However, these results would be difficult to transpose to real clinical conditions. They need validating in a larger study evaluating performance in real-life procedures.
