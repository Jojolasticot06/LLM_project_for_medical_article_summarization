A pilot study of multi-antigen stimulated cell therapy-I plus camrelizumab and apatinib in patients with advanced bone and soft-tissue sarcomas

1/Background: Cell-based immunotherapy shows the therapeutic potential in sarcomas, in addition to angiogenesis-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI). Multi-antigen stimulated cell therapy-I (MASCT-I) technology is a sequential immune cell therapy for cancer, which composes of multiple antigen-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccines followed by the adoptive transfer of anti-tumor effector T-cells.

2/Methods: In this phase 1 study, we assessed MASCT-I plus camrelizumab (an ICI against PD-1) and apatinib (a highly selective TKI targeting VEGFR2) in patients with unresectable recurrent or metastatic bone and soft-tissue sarcoma after at least one line of prior systemic therapy. One MASCT-I course consisted of 3 DC subcutaneous injections, followed by 3 active T cell infusions administered 18-27 days after each DC injection. In schedule-I group, 3 DC injections were administered with a 28-day interval in all courses; in schedule-II group, 3 DC injections were administered with a 7-day interval in the first course and with a 28-day interval thereafter. All patients received intravenous camrelizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks and oral apatinib 250 mg daily.

3/Results: From October 30, 2019, to August 12, 2021, 19 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to schedule-I group (n = 9) and schedule-II group (n = 10). Of the 19 patients, 11 (57.9%) experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events. No treatment-related deaths occurred. Patients in schedule-II group showed similar objective response rate (ORR) with those in schedule-I group (30.0% versus 33.3%) but had higher disease control rate (DCR; 90.0% versus 44.4%) and longer median progression-free survival (PFS; 7.7 versus 4.0 months). For the 13 patients with soft-tissue sarcomas, the ORR was 30.8%, DCR was 76.9%, and median PFS was 12.9 months; for the 6 patients with osteosarcomas, the ORR was 33.3%, the DCR was 50.0%, and median PFS was 5.7 months.

4/Conclusions: Overall, MASCT-I plus camrelizumab and apatinib was safe and showed encouraging efficacy in advanced bone and soft-tissue sarcoma, and schedule-II administration method was recommended.
