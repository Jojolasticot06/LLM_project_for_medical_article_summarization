Antibody persistence and safety after heterologous boosting with orally 
aerosolised Ad5-nCoV in individuals primed with two-dose CoronaVac previously: 
12-month analyses of a randomized controlled trial.

1/Antibody persistence and safety up to 12 months of heterologous orally 
administered adenovirus type-5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine (Ad5-nCoV) in 
individuals who were primed with two-dose inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
(CoronaVac) previously, has not been reported yet. 

2/This randomized, open-label, 
single-centre trial included Chinese adults who have received two-dose CoronaVac 
randomized to low-dose or high-dose aerosolised Ad5-nCoV group, or CoronaVac 
group. In this report, we mainly evaluated the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of 
neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 virus and 
omicron BA.4/5 pseudovirus at 12 months after the booster dose and the incidence 
of serious adverse events (SAEs) till month 12. Of 419 participants, all were 
included in the safety analysis and 120 (28.64%) were included in the 
immunogenicity analysis. 

3/Serum NAb GMT against live wild-type SARS-CoV-2 was 
204.36 (95% CI 152.91, 273.14) in the low-dose group and 171.38 (95% CI 121.27, 
242.19) in the high-dose group at month 12, significantly higher than the GMT in 
the CoronaVac group (8.00 [95% CI 4.22, 15.17], p < 0.0001). Serum NAb GMT 
against omicron BA.4/5 pseudovirus was 40.97 (95% CI 30.15, 55.67) in the 
low-dose group and 35.08 (95% CI 26.31, 46.77) in the high-dose group at month 
12, whereas the GMT in the CoronaVac group was below the lower limit of 
detection. No vaccine-related SAEs were observed. 

4/Orally administered 
aerosolised Ad5-nCoV following two-dose CoronaVac priming has a good safety 
profile and is persistently more immunogenic than three-dose CoronaVac within 12 
months after the booster dose.
