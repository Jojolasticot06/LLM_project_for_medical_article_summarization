Providing genetic testing and genetic counseling for Parkinson's disease to the 
community.

1/PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and impact of offering genetic testing and 
counseling to patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), with the potential to 
enroll in gene-targeted clinical trials and improve clinical care.

2/METHODS: A multicenter, exploratory pilot study at 7 academic hospital sites in 
the United States tracked enrollment and randomized participants to receive 
results and genetic counseling at local sites or by genetic counselors, 
remotely. Follow-up surveys measured participant/provider satisfaction, 
knowledge, and psychological impact.

3/RESULTS: From September 5, 2019 to January 4, 2021, 620 participants were 
enrolled and 387 completed outcome surveys. There were no significant 
differences in outcomes between local and remote sites, with both arms reporting 
high knowledge and satisfaction scores (>80%). Notably, 16% of those tested had 
reportable PD gene variants (pathogenic/likely pathogenic/risk allele).

4/CONCLUSION: Local clinicians, as well as genetic counselors, with educational 
support as needed, can effectively return genetic results for PD as we observed 
favorable outcome measures in both groups. Increasing access to PD genetic 
testing and counseling is urgent; this can inform future efforts to integrate 
genetic testing and counseling into clinical care for all those with PD.
