Isatuximab, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple 
myeloma: updated results from IKEMA, a randomized Phase 3 study.

1/2/Longer-term outcomes with the anti-CD38 antibody isatuximab in combination with 
carfilzomib-dexamethasone (Isa-Kd) were evaluated in the randomized Phase 3 
trial IKEMA (NCT03275285), in a prespecified, follow-up analysis of 
progression-free survival (PFS, primary study endpoint), final complete response 
(CR) using Hydrashift Isa immunofixation assay, minimal residual disease (MRD) 
negativity, and safety. Enrolled patients had relapsed/refractory multiple 
myeloma (1-3 prior treatment lines). Isa 10 mg/kg was administered intravenously 
weekly in cycle 1 then biweekly. 
3/Efficacy analyses were performed in the 
intent-to-treat population (Isa-Kd: n = 179, Kd: n = 123) and safety evaluated 
in treated patients (Isa-Kd: n = 177, Kd: n = 122). Consistent with the primary 
interim analysis, the addition of Isa to Kd prolonged PFS (HR 0.58, 95.4% CI: 
0.42-0.79; median PFS 35.7 [95% CI: 25.8-44.0] vs 19.2 [95% CI: 15.8-25.0] 
months). PFS benefit was observed with Isa-Kd across subgroups, including 
patients with poor prognosis. The stringent CR/CR rate was 44.1% vs 28.5% 
(odds-ratio: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.26-3.48), the MRD negativity rate 33.5% vs 15.4% 
(odds-ratio: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.55-4.99) and the MRD negativity CR rate 26.3% vs 
12.2%, with Isa-Kd vs Kd. The safety profile of Isa-Kd was similar to that 
reported in the prior interim analysis. 
4/These findings further support Isa-Kd as 
a standard-of-care treatment for relapsed multiple myeloma patients.
