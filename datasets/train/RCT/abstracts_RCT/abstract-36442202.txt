BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a high risk group for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Computerized Cognitive Games Training (CCT) is an 
investigational strategy to improve targeted functions in MCI through the 
modulation of cognitive networks.
OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the effect of CCT versus a 
non-targeted active brain exercise on functional cognitive networks.
METHODS: 107 patients with MCI were randomized to CCT or web-based crossword 
puzzles. Resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) was obtained at baseline and 18 
months to evaluate differences in fMRI measured within- and between-network 
functional connectivity (FC) of the default mode network (DMN) and other 
large-scale brain networks: the executive control, salience, and sensorimotor 
networks.
RESULTS: There were no differences between crosswords and games in the primary 
outcome, within-network DMN FC across all subjects. However, secondary analyses 
suggest differential effects on between-network connectivity involving the DMN 
and SLN, and within-network connectivity of the DMN in subjects with late MCI. 
Paradoxically, in both cases, there was a decrease in FC for games and an 
increase for the crosswords control (p < 0.05), accompanied by lesser cognitive 
decline in the crosswords group.
CONCLUSION: Results do not support a differential impact on within-network DMN 
FC between games and crossword puzzle interventions. However, crossword puzzles 
might result in cognitively beneficial remodeling between the DMN and other 
networks in more severely impaired MCI subjects, parallel to the observed 
clinical benefits.
