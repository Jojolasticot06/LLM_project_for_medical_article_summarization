Surgical fixation of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures: elastic intramedullary nailing versus precontoured plating.

1/BACKGROUND: This prospective comparative study was done to evaluate the effectiveness of implants of different design (titanium elastic intramedullary nail versus anatomical precontoured dynamic compression plate) in treatment of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures.

2/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients between 18 and 65 years of age were included in this study. They were randomized in two groups to be treated with either elastic intramedullary nail (EIN) or plate. Clinical and radiological assessments were performed at regular intervals. Outcomes and complications of both groups over 2 years of follow-up time were compared.

3/RESULTS: Length of incision, operation time, blood loss and duration of hospital stay were significantly less for the EIN group. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and Constant Shoulder scores were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the plating group than the EIN group for the first 2 months but there was no significant difference found between the two groups regarding 
functional and radiological outcome at the 2-year follow-up. Significantly higher rates of refracture after implant removal (p = 0.045) in the plating group was observed. Infection and revision surgery rates were also higher in the plate group, but this difference was insignificant (p > 0.05).

4/CONCLUSIONS: EIN is a safe, minimally invasive surgical technique with a lower complication rate, faster return to daily activities, excellent cosmetic and comparable functional results, and can be used as an equally effective alternative to plate fixation in displaced midshaft clavicle fractures.
