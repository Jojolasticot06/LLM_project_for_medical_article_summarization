Among patients with heart failure (HF), more than 
half have HF with preserved rather than reduced 
ejection fraction (HFpEF; HFrEF).1 Despite the 
high prevalence, mortality, and economic burden of 
HFpEF, treatments for this disorder have been limited.
2 Hypertension is a well-established risk factor for 

HFpEF, and recent data suggest that increased central 
blood pressure and large vessel stiffness influence 
ventricular-arterial coupling, and are integral to the 
pathophysiology of HFpEF.3,4 Greater arterial stiffness 

increases left ventricular (LV) pulsatile afterload and 
induces LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, both 
hallmarks of cardiac remodeling in HFpEF.5 Stiffening 
of the large elastic arteries is associated with increased 
risk of systolic hypertension and HF as well as coronary 
artery disease, stroke, and atrial fibrillation.6 Despite 
this, there is currently no approved treatment to prevent 
aortic stiffness. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity 
(PWV), which is the gold standard measure of aortic 
stiffness, approximately doubles between the ages of 
30 and 70 years in humans.7 Given the rapidly growing 
elderly population,8 there is a great unmet clinical 
need to determine the molecular mechanisms leading 
to increased arterial stiffness. 

MGP (matrix Gla protein) is a vitamin K-dependent 
extracellular matrix protein that inhibits vascular calcification. 
Mice that lack MGP develop spontaneous arterial 
calcification at an early age.9,10 Human polymorphisms in 
the MGP gene have been associated with both the presence 
and progression of coronary artery calcification11 
and with incident myocardial infarction,12 although the 
results of these association studies have not always been 
replicated.13,14 The biological activity of MGP depends on 
.-glutamylcarboxylase, an enzyme that converts inactive, 
ucMGP (uncarboxylated MGP) to active, cMGP (carboxylated 
MGP).15 In addition, MGP contains phosphorylated 
serine residues that may also regulate its activity.15 Vitamin 
K serves as an essential cofactor for MGP carboxylation, 
and cMGP is the active form of the protein that 
confers protection against vascular calcification.16 Many 
studies have shown an important association between 
increased ucMGP levels and cardiovascular disease, 
chronic kidney disease, and mortality.17,18 

Higher levels of ucMGP have also been associated 
with increased vascular stiffness in select patient samples.
19,20 Arterial stiffness reflects the reduced ability of 
an artery to expand and contract in response to changes 
in blood pressure. Arterial stiffness increases with 
advancing age and is associated with a higher incidence 
of hypertension, adverse myocardial remodeling with diastolic 
dysfunction, and HFpEF.21 Although higher levels 
of ucMGP are associated with arterial stiffness, a causal 
link between ucMGP and vascular compliance remains 
to be determined and the relationship of ucMGP levels 
with new-onset hypertension and HFpEF is unknown. 

In this study, we examined the association of plasma 
ucMGP levels with arterial stiffness in a large communitybased 
sample. In the context of the known close association 
between arterial stiffness and HF risk, we also 
examined the association between ucMGP with adverse 
LV remodeling and the development of hypertension and 
HFpEF. We also studied mice with heterozygous deletion 
of the Mgp gene to determine effects on the closely 
related trait of aortic pulse wave velocity. Taken together, 
our human and mouse studies sought to implicate an 
important role of MGP in increased arterial stiffness as a 
precursor to HFpEF. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

The data supporting the study findings will be made available 
on reasonable request. FHS data are made publicly available 
and can be accessed through the National Institutes of Health 
database of genotypes and phenotypes (https://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/gap/). Please see the Major Resources Table in the 
Supplemental Material. 

Study Sample 

We studied participants in the Framingham Heart Study, a 
prospective longitudinal community-based observational 
cohort study. Participants who attended the following baseline 
examinations were included: Offspring cohort exam 7 (1998– 
2001, n=3539) and Third Generation exam 1 (2002–2005, 
n=4095).22,23 Individuals with prior HF (n=51), end-stage renal 
disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/minute 

per 1.73 m2, n=25), prevalent atrial fibrillation (n=140), or missing 
biomarker data (n=152) were excluded. No participants 
were taking warfarin, which could alter MGP status. In addition, 
individuals missing information concerning key clinical covariates 
in primary analyses (n=200) were excluded, leaving 7066 
individuals for analysis. For each outcome of interest, we further 
excluded individuals who were missing ascertainment of baseline 
disease status or the outcome (Table S4). The study was 
approved by the appropriate institutional review boards, and all 
participants provided written informed consent. 

Clinical, Biomarker, and Imaging Assessment 

Participants underwent a comprehensive medical history, 
anthropometric assessment, and physical examination. Blood 
pressure was measured in a seated position after at least 5 
minutes of rest, and hypertension was defined as a systolic 
blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 
of at least 90 mmHg, or current use of antihypertensive 
medication. Plasma samples were obtained and immediately 
processed and stored at -80 °C until assayed. Total ucMGP 
was assayed using a modified sandwich ELISA approach, multiplexed 
on a Luminex xMAP platform (Sigma-Aldrich).24 The 
assay had a detection range of 119 to 9110 pg/mL, with interassay 
and intra-assay coefficients of variation of 17.8% and 
10.8%, respectively. Participants underwent evaluation of vascular 
function using applanation tonometry and assessment of 
brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation, as well as standard 
transthoracic echocardiography at the time of baseline (Third 
Generation) or subsequent examination (Offspring cohort exam 
8, 2005–2008) as previously described.25 A subset of 3339 
individuals underwent multidetector computed tomography 
with evaluation of coronary, thoracic aortic, and abdominal aortic 
calcium measurements.26 

Genome-Wide Genotyping and Imputation 

Genome-wide genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 
500K mapping arrays and 50K supplemental Human Gene 
Focused arrays (Affymetrix, Inc, Santa Clara, CA) and the 
Illumina Human Exome BeadChip v.1.0 (Exome Chip; Illumina, 
Inc, San Diego, CA). Imputation was performed using the 1000 
Genomes Project Reference Panel using MACH.27,28 Results 
were filtered for imputation quality ratio <0.8 and minor allele 
frequency <0.01, and a genomic locus was defined using linkage 
disequilibrium r2<0.1. We determined if top SNPs had in 
silico associations with expression quantitative trait loci and relevant 
clinical phenotypes.29 

Clinical Outcome Ascertainment 

We followed participants for longitudinal changes in blood 
pressure and incident hypertension between the baseline and 
follow-up examinations (Offspring exam 8, 2005–2008; Third 
Generation exam 2, 2008–2011). Changes in systolic blood 
pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure were 
defined as the change between the baseline and follow-up 
examinations. Participants were also followed every 2 years for 
medical updates. Medical records were reviewed, and incident 
HF outcomes were adjudicated by a 3-physician panel. Medical 
records were also reviewed for assessment of LV function at or 
around the time of the first HF event. Each incident HF event 

was categorized as HFpEF (LVEF=50%), HFrEF (LVEF<50%), 
or unclassified (no LV function assessment available at or 
around the time of HF event).30 

Statistical Analysis of Framingham Cohort Data 

Baseline clinical characteristics were summarized for each of 
the 2 cohorts. ucMGP concentrations were natural log-transformed 
due to a right-skewed distribution. Clinical correlates of 
ucMGP were examined using stepwise linear regression, forcing 
age and sex into the model, and using P=0.10 for entry 
and P=0.05 for retention in the model. We used linear regression 
to examine the association between the ucMGP level and 
measures of cardiovascular function, including arterial stiffness, 
endothelial function, as well as cardiac structure and function. 
Analyses were first adjusted for age and sex and then additionally 
adjusted for systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive drug 
treatment, diabetes, body mass index, smoking status, total and 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and prevalent myocardial 
infarction. Vascular and echocardiographic strain analyses 
were also adjusted for heart rate. PWV was transformed as the 
negative inverse due to skewness (-1000/PWV) as previously 
described.25 Computed tomography-based analyses examined 
continuous calcium scores after adding 1 unit and log-transformation. 
In cross-sectional analyses, we adjusted for multiple 
hypothesis testing using a Bonferroni-corrected threshold of 
P<0.01 (5 primary traits: coronary artery calcium, PWV, left 
atrial diameter, LV mass index). 

We examined the association between the level of ucMGP 
and changes in blood pressure and incident hypertension at 
baseline and follow-up examinations using linear and logistic 
regression, respectively. For continuous blood pressure analyses, 
we imputed blood pressure for participants taking antihypertensive 
medications by adding 5 mmHg to the diastolic and 10 
mmHg to the systolic blood pressure, as previously described.31 
Models were first adjusted for age and sex and further adjusted 
for baseline blood pressure, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, 
total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and prevalent 
myocardial infarction. Multivariable Cox regression models were 
used to examine the association between ucMGP level and incident 
HFpEF or HFrEF. Models accounted for multiple competing 
risks (death, other subtype of HF, and unclassified HF). We 
tested the proportional hazards assumption and found it was not 
violated. We also performed sex-stratified analyses and tested 
for ucMGP*sex interactions. All analyses were conducted using 
SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute). 

A genome-wide association study of MGP concentrations 
was performed using an additive genetic model in a 
linear mixed effects model (“LMEKIN” function, Kinship 
Package, R). We defined cis variants within 1 Mb of the MGP 
gene. The threshold for genome-wide significance was set 
at P<5×10-8 with suggestive associations at P<1×10-6 . We 
performed Mendelian Randomization testing using 2 cis-
SNP variants (P<10-5, LD r2<0.1) as instrumental variables 
to examine whether MGP was causal for arterial stiffness as 
ascertained by PWV.32 

Mouse Echocardiography 

All experiments involving mice were approved by the Partners 
Subcommittee on Research Animal Care (Protocol No. 
2008N000169). C57Bl/6 wild-type and MGP+/- heterozygous 

mice were used in this study.9,33 Heterozygous mice were chosen 
for this study, since MGP-/- homozygous mice invariably 
succumb to severe aortic calcification with aortic rupture at 
˜6 weeks of age.9 Mice were anesthetized with continuous 
flow ˜1.5% isoflurane gas and placed in a supine position 
for imaging. Mice were subsequently prepared for imaging 
by connecting ECG electrodes to limbs and using a chemical 
hair remover (Nair, Carter-Horner, Mississauga, ON, Canada) 
on the skin over the area to be imaged.34 Mouse echocardiography 
was performed using an ultrasound biomicroscope 
(Vevo770, VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada).35 Imaging of 
the abdominal aorta was conducted using the RMV 704 scanner 
probe with a central frequency of 40 MHz, a focal length 
of 6 mm, and a field of view of 10 mm×10 mm, as previously 
described.35 Briefly, using the M-mode setting, the velocity of 
blood flow in the center of the aortic vessel was measured at 
the proximal and distal ends of the field of view. The distances 
between the foot of the flow waveform and the R-wave of the 
ECG (arrival times) and the distance between the 2 points of 
measurement in the aorta were determined post-acquisition 
using the Vevo770 software and averaged over 5 to 10 cardiac 
cycles. PWV was calculated by dividing the distance between 
the proximal and distal locations (in millimeters) by the difference 
in the proximal and distal arrival times of the waveforms 
(in milliseconds), as previously described.35,36 

Mouse Cardiac Magnetic Resonance 

C57Bl/6 wild-type and MGP+/- heterozygote mice were anesthetized 
with continuous flow ˜2% isoflurane gas in a chamber 
and then transferred to a face mask and placed in a headfirst 
prone position for MRI scanning. Mice were subsequently prepared 
for imaging by connecting ECG electrodes to limbs, placing 
a body temperature probe, and placing a respiratory pillow 
under their abdomen. Mouse cardiac magnetic resonance was 
performed on a small bore 4.7T scanner (Biospec 47/40 USR, 
Bruker, Billerica, MA). As previously described,37,38 2D time 
resolved phase contrast imaging (98×98 µm,2 1 mm slice thickness, 
repetition time/echo time=5.3 ms/1.6 ms, 5 1 ms trigger 
delays with interleaving for view sharing temporal resolution of 
1 ms, 4 averages) of the descending aorta was conducted at 
2 single perpendicular slices 1 cm apart in encoding for the 
through-plane flow at VENC=170 cm/s. PWV was calculated 
from slice separation (1 cm) divided by the time difference of 
the upslope from the velocity time curve using the multi-point 
transit time method39 of the pulse traveling from one slice to 
the other. Conventional myocardial balanced steady-state free 
precession imaging (repetition time=8 ms, echo time=2.5 ms, 
128×128 µm,2 1 mm slice thickness, 20 phases)40 was performed 
to measure cardiac function. Reference myocardial T1 
mapping (single echo nonselective inversion recovery gradient 
echo, repetition time=3008 ms, echo time=2.4 ms, TI=150, 
300, 500, 900, 1500, and 3000 ms) was performed to yield 
native T1 values. 

Aortic Immunofluorescence and Histology 

Aortas were fixed in formalin (10%) for 24 hours before paraffinization 
and sectioning (6-µm). Staining with Verhoeff-
Van Gieson and Masson’s Trichrome (Thermo Scientific, MI) 
were performed for assessment of elastin integrity and collagen 
deposition, respectively. Two-dimensional images were 

analyzed using imageJ software. Aortas were also embedded 
and cryopreserved in optimal cutting-temperature medium 
(Sakura Tissue-Tek, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands), and 6-µm 
sections were prepared. To detect specific collagens in aortas, 
frozen tissue sections were fixed in cold 100% methanol and 
incubated with primary antibodies specific for COL1 (collagen 
1; Abcam, No. ab34710) and COL3 (Abcam, No. ab6310). 
The location of F-actin and nuclei were identified by staining 
with F-actin (ActinGreenTM 488 ReadyProbes, ThermoFisher 
Scientific) and 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, respectively. 

Separate histological sections from the same mice were 
prepared for ex vivo alizarin red staining to assess calcium content, 
as previously described.41,42 Briefly, sections were deparaffinized 
and stained with 2% Alizarin red (pH 4.2) for 5 minutes 
at room temperature and rinsed repeatedly with distilled water. 
Images of whole aortas were captured with a low magnification 
microscope (magnification, ×10; Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope) 
in a darkened background. 

siRNA-Mediated Knockdown of MGP in 
Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells 

siRNA directed against human and mouse MGP (siMGP) 
and scrambled control siRNA (siSC) were obtained from 
Dharmacon (SMARTpool, Thermo Scientific). Human aortic 
smooth muscle cells (Cell Applications No. 355-75a) and 
murine aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (ATCC CRL-2797) 
were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX 
reagent, as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies). 

Measurement of Gene Expression by 
Quantitative RT-PCR 

Total RNA from aortas and cells were extracted by the phenol/
guanidinium method. Reverse transcription was performed 
using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription 
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). A Mastercycler ep 
Realplex (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) was used for realtime 
amplification and quantification of transcripts. Relative 
expression of target transcripts were normalized to levels of 
18S ribosomal RNA, determined using the relative CT method. 
Taqman gene expression assays were used to quantify mRNA 
levels encoding MGP, RUNX2, COL1A1, and COL1A2. 

Near-Infrared Imaging and Quantification of 
Aortic Calcification 

To quantify aortic calcification, age-matched wild-type and 
Mgp+/- mice, as well as Mgp-/- mice as a positive control, 
were injected via the tail vein with OsteoSense-680 
(PerkinElmer, 2 µL/g each) 24 hours before euthanasia, as 
described previously.33 Aortas were isolated and analyzed ex 
vivo by fluorescence reflectance imaging using an Odyssey 
Imaging System (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE) and 
software version 3.0.16.43,44 

Statistical Analysis 

Statistical analyses for the murine and in vitro experiments 
were performed using Graph Pad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad 
Software, La Jolla, CA) and Stata 13.0 (StataCorp LLC). The 
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the normality of each 

continuous variable, and all such variables were found to be measures of arterial stiffness, including carotid-femoral 

normally distributed. Data are reported as mean±SEM, unless 
otherwise indicated. For > 2 group comparisons of continuous 
variables, 2-tailed 1-way ANOVA with Sidak post hoc testing 
was employed. A 2-sided P<0.05 was considered to be statistically 
significant. 

RESULTS 

Baseline characteristics of the 7066 participants (mean age 
49 years, 54% women) are presented in Table S1. Higher 
ucMGP levels were associated with older age and male sex. 
In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, higher ucMGP concentrations 
were also associated with other cardiovascular risk 
factors including higher blood pressure, higher body mass 
index, hyperlipidemia, and lower estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (Table S2). In addition, levels of ucMGP were 
higher among those with previous myocardial infarction. 

Among a subset of 3339 individuals with ascertainment 
of vascular calcification, 44% had coronary, 23% 
had thoracic, and 53% had abdominal aortic calcification 
as defined by a computed tomography–based calcium 
score of >0. We found no significant associations 
between the levels of ucMGP and coronary, thoracic aortic, 
or abdominal aortic calcium deposition (P>0.05 for all, 
Table 1). In contrast, ucMGP levels were associated with 

PWV and central pulse pressure (Table 1). A 1-SD unit 
higher log-transformed ucMGP was associated with a 

0.122 SD higher PWV (negative inverse transformed) in 
age- and sex-adjusted analyses (SE 0.009, P<0.001). 
After adjusting for other clinical covariates, the ucMGP 
levels remained independently associated with PWV 
(beta 0.040, SE 0.008, P<0.001). Higher levels of 
ucMGP were also associated with decreased brachial 
flow-mediated vasodilation (age- and sex-adjusted beta 
-0.040, SE 0.012, P=0.001), which is a marker of endothelial 
dysfunction; however, this association was not 
significant in the multivariable-adjusted model (P=0.39). 
Higher levels of ucMGP were also associated with 
echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and 
function, including increased left atrial diameter and 
relative wall thickness as well as worse LV global longitudinal 
strain (P=0.0002 for all, Table 1). In multivariableadjusted 
analyses, ucMGP remained associated with 
worse global longitudinal strain (P=0.005); however this 
relationship was attenuated after additionally adjusting 
for heart rate (P=0.07). 

In longitudinal multivariable analyses, we observed 
that higher baseline ucMGP levels were associated with 
future increases in systolic but not diastolic blood pressure, 
resulting in a widening in pulse pressure, adjusting

for other clinical variables (Table 2). Using multivariable 
analyses, 1-unit higher baseline log-transformed ucMGP 
level was associated with a future 1.7 mmHg increase in 
pulse pressure (SE 0.34, P<0.0001). Baseline ucMGP 
levels were associated with the development of hypertension: 
1-SD unit higher baseline ucMGP level was 
associated with a 41% higher odds of future hypertension 
(age- and sex-adjusted OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.28– 
1.55], P<0.001). This association was attenuated after 
multivariable adjustment (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.99–1.23], 
P=0.07). We selected covariates a priori based on the 
fact that they were known to be traditional clinical risk 
factors associated with the development of HF and 
hypertension in prior studies based in Framingham Heart 
Study participants. Further adjustment for estimated glomerular 
filtration rate did not result in substantive differences. 
It is of note that the associations of ucMGP with 
central pulse pressure, brachial flow-mediated vasodilation, 
and LV relative wall thickness were attenuated when 
adjusting for systolic blood pressure, thus supporting a 
direct impact of ucMGP on vascular function. 

Over a median follow-up period of 12 years, 197 
participants developed incident heart failure, with 101 
classified as HFpEF and 77 as HFrEF. Higher baseline 
ucMGP levels were associated with increased risk 
of incident overall HF (multivariable-adjusted hazard 
ratio per 1-SD unit increase in ucMGP, 1.34 [95% CI, 
1.13–1.59], P=0.001). Of note, ucMGP levels were specifically 
associated with incident HFpEF with no significant 
association with HFrEF (HFpEF: hazard ratio, 1.51 
[95% CI, 1.18–1.94], P=0.001; HFrEF: hazard ratio, 
1.24 [95% CI, 0.95–1.62], P=0.12). 

We found 2 genome-wide significant loci on chromosome 
12 associated with circulating ucMGP levels (Table 
S3): rs1800801 in the 5’ untranslated region of the 
MGP gene itself (P<10-100), and rs4764124, which is 

located within an intron of the SMCO3 gene (single-pass 
membrane protein with coiled-coil domains 3) and is 
near the MGP locus (P=6.9×10-10). There were two missense 
variants in linkage disequilibrium with rs1800801: 
rs4236 (MGP, P=1.7×10-38) and rs11276 (ART4 [ADPribosyltransferase 
4], P=5.5×10-38), both predicted to be 
tolerated, benign variants,45,46 and 2 synonymous SNPs 
rs1861698 (ART4, P<10-100) and rs3088189 (ART4, 
P=6.0×10-38) that were also associated with circulating 
ucMGP levels. We found 2 cis-protein quantitative trait 
loci (cis-pQTLs, defined as loci associated with ucMGP 
levels with P<1×10-5, located within 1 Mb of the MGP 
gene, pruned to linkage disequilibrium r2<0.1) and used 
these as instrumental variables for ucMGP to test associations 
with PWV using 2-sample Mendelian randomization. 
One of the 2 cis-pQTLs was suggestive of a causal 
relationship of MGP levels to PWV (MR test P=0.04). 

We searched our top MGP locus SNP rs1800801 
against published databases of gene expression and 
known clinical phenotypes.29 We found that rs1800801 
was associated with MGP expression in various tissues 
(nerve, P=1.0×10-11; lung, P=1.1×10-4; thyroid 
P=1.9×10-6) as well as mRNA expression of other 
genes. In vascular beds, rs1800801 was associated 
with expression of SMCO3 (aorta, P=1.4×10-5; coronary, 
P=1.1×10-4), C12orf60 (tibial artery, P=5.8×10-6 , 
aorta P=7.0×10-8, coronary P=8.7×10-4), ERP27 (aorta, 
P=1.6×10-17; coronary P=2.3×10-9), and ARHGDIB 
(tibial artery, P=4.7×10-5; aorta P=3.7×10-6). Missense 
variants in MGP were also associated with lumbar bone 
mineral density (lowest P=1.9×10-4). 

Functional data indicate that MGP is a potent inhibitor 
of vascular calcification.9,16 However, in our study, higher 
ucMGP levels were associated with increased arterial 
stiffness, increased cardiovascular disease, and adverse 
outcomes presumably because of counterregulatory

or compensatory mechanisms related to MGP expression 
and/or possibly because ucMGP is not adequately 
modified by vitamin K-dependent gamma carboxylase to 
form cMGP, the biologically active protein.17 To determine 
whether MGP levels are causally related to vascular stiffness, 
we compared aortic PWV in age- and sex-matched 
young and old Mgp+/- and wild-type mice. All female mice 
were nulliparous. It was not possible to study Mgp-/- 
mice because these mice develop spontaneous arterial 
calcification by 2 weeks of age and die of aortic rupture 
by ˜6 weeks of age.9 In contrast to Mgp-/- mice, heterozygous 
Mgp+/- mice do not develop appreciable arterial 
calcification even at 12 months of age, as measured by 
Osteosense near-infrared fluorescence (Figure S1A). 
Furthermore, there was no detectable difference in calcium 
content in aortic sections from Mgp+/- mice, compared 
with wild-type mice, as evidenced by Alizarin red 
staining (Figure S1B). In 4-month-old mice (Figure 1A), 
the aortic PWV assessed by echocardiography was similar 
in Mgp+/- and wild-type mice, with no apparent sex 
differences (mean±SEM; female: 1.8±0.2 m/s versus 
2.3±0.3, P=0.38; male: 2.2±0.2 versus 2.2±0.4 m/s, 
P=0.99). However, at 10 months of age (Figure 1B), 
female Mgp+/- mice had a higher aortic PWV compared 
with female wild-type mice (7.6±0.5 versus 2.5±0.2 m/s, 
P<0.0001). There was no difference between the aortic 
PWV of 10-month-old male Mgp+/- mice and wildtype 
mice (3.6±0.7 versus 3.5±0.5 m/s, P>0.99). These 
results indicate that Mgp heterozygosity in older female 
mice causes increased arterial stiffness. 

To determine whether the difference in aortic stiffness 
observed in older female versus male Mgp+/- mice 
is due to sex-specific differences in Mgp expression levels, 
aortic Mgp mRNA levels were measured by qPCR 
(Figure 1C). Mgp expression levels were decreased by 
>60% in aortas isolated from aged female and male 
Mgp+/- mice when compared with age-matched wildtype 
female and male mice. These results suggest that 
the sex-specific differences in the effects of Mgp heterozygosity 
on the development of vascular stiffness are not 
associated with sex-specific differences in aortic Mgp 
mRNA expression levels. 

To further support our echocardiographic findings, we 
assessed PWV and myocardial T1 mapping using mouse 
cardiac magnetic resonance. As shown in Figure S2A 
and S2B, PWV was increased in female Mgp+/- mice 
(7.6±0.6 m/s) compared with male Mgp+/- mice (2.7±0.1 
m/s, P<0.0001) and female wild-type (2.3±0.1 m/s, 
P<0.0001). Further, T1-weighted signals (a marker of 
LV fibrosis) were higher in the left ventricles of female 
Mgp+/- mice (1337±7.0 ms) relative to female wild-type 
mice (Figure S2C and S2D, 1313±4.7 ms, P=0.045). 
However, female Mgp+/- mice did not exhibit different 
LVEF or LV end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes (Figure 
S3) compared with male Mgp+/- mice or wild-type 
mice. These findings indicate that Mgp heterozygosity 


Figure 1. Arterial stiffness is increased in 10-mo-old female 
Mgp+/- mice. 
A, No difference was observed in pulse wave velocity (PWV) 
between female and male wild-type (WT) and Mgp+/- mice at 4 mo 
of age. B, Ten-month-old female Mgp+/- mice had increased PWV 
compared with age-matched WT female mice, but no difference 
between male Mgp+/- and WT mice was observed. PWV was higher 
in 10-mo-old female Mgp+/- mice than their male counterparts. C, 
Mgp heterozygosity is associated with a >60% decrease in aortic 
expression of Mgp mRNA. mRNA expression levels of Mgp were 
significantly lower in aged Mgp+/- female and male mice (n=7 in 
each group) compared with age-matched wild-type mice (n=5 in 
each group). No difference in aortic Mgp mRNA levels was detected 
between Mgp+/- female and male mice. Statistical comparisons were 
made with a 1-way ANOVA with Sidak post hoc testing. 


in older female mice results in increased aortic stiffness 
and is associated with a higher degree of cardiac fibrosis 
compared with wild-type mice. 

Aortic stiffness is primarily dependent on changes in 
the matrix composition of the vessel’s medial layer with 
elastin fiber disruption and increased collagen deposition. 
In particular, collagen I plays a crucial role in arterial 
stiffening, the expression of which is induced by Runx2 
(Runt-related transcription factor 2).47 We therefore 
sought to investigate the pathological consequences 
underlying the role of MGP heterozygosity in arterial 
stiffness. First, we determined the histological changes 
associated with Mgp heterozygosity. We focused on 
female mice, given the fact we only demonstrated 
increased stiffness in female Mgp heterozygote mice. 
While the aortas of 10-month-old wild-type mice were 
histologically normal, the aortas of 10-month-old Mgp+/- 
mice had elastin fiber fragmentation (Figure 2A) and collagen 
accumulation (absolute increase of 34.1±7.0%) 
in the medial layer (Figure 2B). A substantial induction 
of collagen I (COLI) protein expression was observed in 
the aortic media from Mgp+/- mice via immunofluorescence 
(Figure 2C). However, no increase in COL3 was 
observed in the aortas from Mgp heterozygote mice. To 
further study the role of MGP on the regulation of collagen 
expression, we treated murine aortic vascular smooth 
muscle cells (Figure 2D) and human aortic smooth 
muscle cells (Figure 2E) with an siRNA targeting MGP. 
Silencing MGP (˜70% in murine aortic vascular smooth 
muscle cells and 95% in human aortic smooth muscle 
cells) increased the expression of RUNX2 (˜30% in 
murine aortic vascular smooth muscle cells and >2-fold 
in human aortic smooth muscle cells). In addition, and 
consistent with the immunofluorescent results, knockdown 
of MGP resulted in an increase in Col1a1 and 
Col1a2 mRNA levels in mouse aortic SMCs (Figure 2D). 
Similarly, in human aortic SMCs, knockdown of MGP 
increased COL1A2 by >40% but did not significantly 
affect COL1A1 expression. These findings indicate that 
MGP heterozygosity is associated with increased aortic 
collagen I protein expression and that, similarly, reduced 
MGP levels in vascular smooth muscle cells result in 
increased expression of RUNX2 and collagen I. 

DISCUSSION 

We examined the role of MGP in the development of 
arterial stiffness as a precursor to HFpEF using complementary 
studies in a large human community-based 
cohort and a mouse model of MGP heterozygosity. 
Our findings were as follows: first, increased levels of 
ucMGP were associated with increased vascular stiffness 
as measured by aortic PWV and were associated 
with measures of cardiac function including LV strain. 
Second, circulating ucMGP levels portended the future 
development of pulse pressure widening and HFpEF in a 

large cohort. To determine if MGP was causally related to 
vascular stiffness, we took 2 approaches. We used SNPs 
associated with ucMGP levels as instrumental variables 
and found that Mendelian randomization analysis implicated 
ucMGP as causal for PWV. We also ascertained 
aortic PWV in MGP heterozygote mice. Compared with 
matched wild-type mice, female MGP+/- mice had a 
3-fold increase in aortic PWV with concomitant cardiac 
fibrosis. Taken together, these observations are consistent 
with a direct role for MGP in regulating the development 
of vascular stiffness. Our findings also suggest that 
MGP-related vascular effects may contribute to the risk 
of HFpEF. 

Although our mouse models indicate a protective benefit 
of MGP in arterial stiffness, higher ucMGP levels were 
associated with increased arterial stiffness, increased cardiovascular 
disease, and adverse outcomes presumably 
because (1) circulating MGP levels are upregulated secondarily 
and compensatory to a primary insult and/or (2) 
ucMGP is not adequately modified by vitamin K-dependent 
gamma carboxylase to form cMGP, the biologically 
active protein. Our prior work in patients with calciphylaxis 
and end-stage renal disease suggest that, while ucMGP 
levels are elevated in states of vascular disease, the ratio 
of cMGP:ucMGP is lower in the disease state.17 Similarly, 
in the calcification disorder pseudoxanthoma elasticum, 
defective carboxylation of MGP is observed and the ratio 
of cMGP:ucMGP is reduced.48,49 Furthermore, in patients 
with chronic heart failure, while levels of ucMGP were 
higher with worsening HF severity, the ratio of cMGP to 
ucMGP was lower in more severe states of HF.50 Therefore, 
reduced activation of MGP to the carboxylated form 
appears to be an important factor in cardiovascular disorders. 
Similarly, our in vitro and in vivo findings support 
a protective role of active MGP in arterial stiffness. We 
therefore hypothesize that arterial stiffness is manifested 
by inadequate or insufficient modification to the active 
(carboxylated) form of MGP. 

There are different species of MGP in the circulation 
and, to become fully active, MGP must both be carboxylated 
and phosphorylated.51 Both ucMGP and dp-ucMGP 
(dephosphorylated uncarboxylated matrix GLA protein) 
represent fractions of MGP that are inactive.15 
Furthermore, both ucMGP and dp-ucMGP have been 
associated with cardiovascular disease, however some 
differences have been noted in these associations.17,51–55 
For instance, ucMGP has been associated with cardiovascular 
disease in patients with known CAD but not in 
diabetics, whereas dp-ucMGP is associated with risk 
in diabetics.56 One potential explanation for this is that 
ucMGP, which consists of phosphorylated MGP species, 
may behave differently than dp-ucMGP at a biologic level 
in tissues, thus differentially affecting circulating levels. 
A limitation of our investigation is that whereas ucMGP 
associations with arterial stiffness, hypertension, and 
HFpEF were determined, dp-ucMGP was not measured.

mice. D, Treatment of mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (n=6 biologically independent samples in each group) with siMGP (resulting in 
>70% knockdown of Mgp mRNA) caused an increase in Runx2, Col1a1, and Col1a2 expression (Student t test). E, Treatment of human 
aortic smooth muscle cells (n=6 biologically independent samples in each group) with siMGP (resulting in >90% knockdown of MGP 
mRNA) increased RUNX2 and COL1A2 mRNA levels (Student t test). 

While the primary focus of MGP has been on its role in addition, separate smaller studies (<200 individuals) 
the development of vascular calcification, a few previous have found a strong association between dp-ucMGP 
studies have suggested a potential association with arte-and CF-PWV in both hypertensive and diabetic indirial 
stiffness.19,20,57–60 Recent studies demonstrated that viduals, further supporting a role for MGP with arterial 
aortic PWV independently correlated with dp-ucMGP stiffness.57,59 We extend these findings to show an assoin 
European populations (˜1000 individuals).19,20,58,60 In ciation of circulating ucMGP levels with arterial stiffness 

in >7000 individuals. While a previous study found an 
association between dp-ucMGP and worse outcomes in 
patients with chronic heart failure, ours is the first study to 
show such an association with future incident HFpEF.50 
It has been suggested that abnormal ventricular-vascular 
coupling, caused by increased arterial stiffness, may contribute 
to the pathophysiology of HFpEF.50 

MGP has an established protective role against vascular 
calcification through inhibition of BMP (bone morphogenetic 
protein) signaling and direct binding and 
inhibition of calcium phosphate crystal growth in the 
extracellular matrix.33,61 In human studies, both polymorphisms 
in the MGP gene and increased circulating MGP 
levels have been associated with coronary artery calcification 
and cardiovascular events.11,62 Furthermore, mice 
that lack both alleles of MGP develop spontaneous arterial 
calcification at an early age.9 For this reason, previous 
studies have suggested that MGP influences vascular 
stiffness through its role in preventing calcification.20,57 
It was interesting, therefore, that ucMGP levels were 
associated with vascular stiffness in the absence of an 
association with detectable vascular calcification. However, 
our study is limited in that the human and mouse 
imaging techniques may not be able to detect microcalcifications.
63,64 Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility 
that microcalcification is the mechanism by which MGP 
heterozygosity increases aortic stiffness. Our findings are 
substantiated by Mendelian randomization results showing 
that ucMGP genetic proxies are associated with PWV 
in humans. Importantly, ucMGP requires activation by a 
vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, therefore making the 
MGP pathway modifiable with vitamin K therapy. Indeed, 
recent studies have demonstrated that Vitamin K2 treatment 
is protective against age-related aortic stiffening in 
243 healthy adults, but it will be important to study the 
effects of vitamin K therapy in larger cohorts with vascular 
disease.65 We further demonstrated that 10-month-old 
female, but not male, MGP+/- mice developed increased 
aortic stiffness, in the context of ˜50% lower aortic MGP 
mRNA levels, compared with wild-type mice. It was notable 
that only female MGP+/- mice developed increased 
aortic stiffness, especially given recent findings that 
Vitamin K2 treatment prevented age-related aortic stiffness 
increases only in postmenopausal women.65 These 
findings allude to a possible female-predominant role 
for MGP in the development of vascular stiffness. Taken 
together, our results suggest that MGP heterozygosity is 
a cause for arterial stiffness and that, in humans, arterial 
stiffness is associated with increased ucMGP levels, the 
inactive form of the protein. 

The exact mechanisms that link ucMGP with arterial 
stiffness, particularly before detectable arterial macrocalcification, 
remain unclear. We show here a direct effect 
of MGP deficiency on aortic collagen expression in mice, 
pointing to a possible mechanistic link between MGP 
and arterial stiffness. Arterial compliance is regulated, 

in large part, by the relative contribution of the scaffolding 
proteins: collagen and elastin. Previous studies have 
reported a prominent role for type I collagen metabolism 
in the development of arterial stiffness.66,67 Similarly, our 
data points to an influence of MGP on type I collagen 
accumulation. Furthermore, MGP may influence stiffness 
through its inhibition of Runx2 expression, which 
was previously found to induce arterial stiffness in a diabetic 
mouse model.47 Interestingly, while the in vitro data 
points to a mechanistic link between MGP deficiency 
and increased arterial stiffness through the increased 
production of collagen, reduced levels of Mgp in male 
aortas did not manifest in increased PWV. This possibly 
relates to sex-specific levels of complexity in the in 
vivo model that remain unknown. Future studies will be 
needed to understand the interplay between MGP and 
sex-specific hormones and/or gene expression and how 
this relates to arterial stiffening. 

Beyond its association with arterial stiffness, we show 
that ucMGP is associated with LV systolic mechanics, 
as well as the future development of hypertension and 
HFpEF. Hypertension is a well-established risk factor 
for HFpEF, and recent data suggest that central blood 
pressure and large vessel stiffness in particular appear 
integral to the pathophysiology of HFpEF.3,68 Arterial 
stiffness increases LV pulsatile afterload and induces 
LV hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction, both hall-
marks of cardiac remodeling in HFpEF.3,5 Further, concomitant 
vascular and ventricular stiffening results in 
abnormal coupling, adversely affecting cardiovascular 
function.69 Our findings substantiate an important role 
of ucMGP in this process. 

We also explored genetic determinants of ucMGP levels 
using a genome-wide association study. Not surprisingly, 
we found an association between circulating ucMGP levels 
and rs1800801 near the MGP gene (P<10-100). This 
MGP gene variant has previously been associated with 
vascular calcification and atherosclerotic disease.70 Previous 
studies have demonstrated that this SNP has a crucial 
role on the promoter activity of the MGP gene.12 We then 
used SNPs associated with ucMGP levels as instrumental 
variables and found that Mendelian randomization analysis 
implicated ucMGP as causal for PWV, strengthening our 
observational findings of ucMGP and arterial stiffness. 

There are limitations in our study that deserve mention. 
First, this study focuses on the measurement of 
ucMGP and not the active, carboxylated form of MGP 
(cMGP). Antibodies specific to cMGP are not available 
at this time, as they once were previously.17 Thus, we are 
unable to comment on the relative ratio of active:inactive 
MGP. Second, we cannot exclude residual confounding 
or establish causal relationships with our cohort study by 
virtue of its observational design. Third, our cohort study 
included middle-aged and older adults who were largely 
of European ancestry; the generalizability of our human 
data to other ages and races/ethnicities is unknown. 

Fourth, both Mendelian Randomization analysis and a 
murine model were used to provide evidence of a causal 
link between MGP and arterial stiffness. However, only 
female Mgp+/- mice developed increased aortic PWV 
and not male Mgp+/- mice. Sex-specific differences 
were not observed in the human cohort. Future investigation 
is needed to understand the sex-specific findings 
of Mgp+/- mice. 

In summary, we identified novel associations between 
ucMGP and increased risk of large artery stiffening, elevated 
systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure widening, 
and future HFpEF. These observational findings are reinforced 
by Mendelian randomization analyses showing a 
putative causal association with PWV, as well as functional 
studies using Mgp+/- mice, that provide further evidence 
for a mechanistic role for MGP in the protection against 
large artery stiffening with aging. Our findings support the 
novel hypothesis that MGP regulates arterial stiffness.
