Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause 
of death that increases with age independent from 
traditional risk factors, thus influencing exploration of 
nontraditional risks. Recent investigations suggest clonal 
hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP) may 
play an important role as an age-dependent accelerator 
of atherosclerosis.1,2 The accumulation of mutant somatic 
clones arising from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells 

that constitute CHIP has been identified in genes central to 
inflammatory regulation.3,4 Although the presence of CHIP 
is less likely to result in hematologic malignancy, the risk for 
CAD and all-cause mortality in patients with CHIP nearly 
doubles with a likely pathogenic role in vascular disease.5 


The vascular wall is a prime site exposed to the atherogenic 
effects of inflammation and other risk mediators 
that underly the development of CAD. Resulting 
coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is one of 
the earliest detectable features of injury in atherogenesis 
and a known feature of increased cardiovascular 
risk.6 Invasive functional testing is used to characterize 
small vessel injury that occurs by endotheliumindependent 
or endothelium-dependent mechanisms 
that impair vasodilation.7,8 In the absence of obstructive 
CAD, CMD represents early vascular insult influenced 
by the summation of circulating and hemodynamic risk 
mediators.9 Impaired coronary microvascular tone in the 
absence of obstructive CAD remains a hallmark finding 
in early vascular aging. Specifically, a low coronary 
flow reserve (CFR; generally considered CFR =2) in 
CMD reflects predominant endothelium-independent 
dysfunction and may indicate structural and functional 
alterations in vascular smooth muscle cells with associated 
impaired vasodilation, resulting in downstream 
consequence to microvascular function. Patients with 
low CFR are at risk for obstructive CAD, acute myocardial 
infarction, and major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACEs).10,11 

Our understanding of the role of CHIP in vascular 
injury in humans remains unclear and continues to 
evolve with emerging clinical evidence.12 Although clinical 
observations have traditionally associated CHIP with 
macrovascular complications such as obstructive CAD, 
recent evidence in heart failure and cerebral vascular 
disease suggests significant microvascular associations 
likely influenced by alternate mechanistic pathways.13–15 
Thus, we aimed to investigate the association between 
CH and CHIP in CMD. The investigation selected a 
unique cohort of patients with no CAD and CMD present 
at the earliest stages of atherosclerotic vascular 
injury. We hypothesized somatic mutations in leukemiaassociated 
driver genes in hematopoietic stem and progenitor 
cells (1) were associated with CMD and (2) may 

METHODS 
Ethical Statement and Data Availability 

The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board approved the current 
study. Written consent was obtained from all participants. 
The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of 
the Declaration of Helsinki. Reasonable requests for supportive 
data are available by the corresponding author. 

Study Population 

Patients with chest pain and no known obstructive CAD, 
history of angiogram, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or 
known structural heart disease between the years 1993 and 
2015 were referred for coronary angiogram at Mayo Clinic 
in Rochester, Minnesota. If no CAD was confirmed during 
angiogram (<40% stenosis of major coronary arteries), 
participants were considered eligible for enrollment and a 
functional coronary angiogram was then performed. For the 
current retrospective investigation, 177 of these participants 
with CMD and controls with no CMD were selected consecutively. 
The total number of consecutive participants was 
determined by funding available for primary and secondary 
CHIP mutational analysis. 

Invasive Coronary Function Testing 

The study protocol has been described in detail elsewhere.
8,16–18 Patients presenting to the catheterization laboratory 
with nonobstructive coronary artery (<40% angiographic 
stenosis in major vessels) underwent invasive coronary functional 
testing using an intracoronary Doppler guidewire. A 

Doppler guidewire (0.014-inch FloWire; Philips/Volcano, Inc) 
was advanced 2 to 3 mm distal to the tip of 2.2F coronary 
infusion catheter (Ultrafuse; SciMed Life System) positioned 
into the mid-portion of the left anterior descending artery. 
In all patients, acetylcholine was selectively infused into the 
left anterior descending artery at concentrations of 10-6, 
10-5, and 10-4 mol/L over 3 minutes at each concentration. 
Doppler measurements were obtained after each infusion. 
Coronary artery diameter was measured in segment 5 mm 
distal to the tip of the Doppler wire. The percentage change 
in epicardial coronary artery diameter in response to acetylcholine 
was measured and recorded at the proximal, mid, and 
distal left anterior descending artery. Endothelium-dependent 
microvascular function was derived from calculations of coronary 
blood flow (CBF): p×average peak velocity×coronary 
artery radius. Percentage change in CBF was calculated as 
a percentage increase in CBF following infusion of intracoronary 
acetylcholine. Incremental doses of intracoronary adenosine 
as consecutive boluses of 24 to 72 µg until maximal 
hyperemia were achieved. CFR was determined by the ratio 
of maximal hyperemia with intracoronary adenosine and basal 
flow at rest. CFR =2 was consistent with a clinical diagnosis 
of CMD associated with cardiovascular disease and MACE as 
described previously.8,13,18–20 

Clinical and Biochemical Data 

Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained 
through medical record, history, and physical examination as 
described previously.17,21 Patients were given the option to voluntarily 
disclose race and ethnic data for documentation in 
their medical record. Categories of race were suggested by 
the medical institution, and it requested participants of Middle-
Eastern or North-African descent to identify as White people. 
Stored venous blood collected within 2 weeks before coronary 
angiogram was used for routine biochemical, cytokine, and 
CHIP analysis. Buffy coat and plasma samples extracted from 
whole blood were used for the collection of DNA. A standardized 
follow-up questionnaire sent at one time point assessed 
the incidence of hematologic malignancy MACE (myocardial 
infarction, revascularization for stable angina, percutaneous 
coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass grafting, and 
stroke). Self-reported data were independently adjudicated 
and confirmed by patient electronic medical record by an 
independent investigator. 

Detection of CH by Targeted Capture Assays 

DNA was extracted from buffy coat samples following the 
procedures in the Qiagen Puregene kit. We sequenced the 
entire coding regions of 35 genes using a customized 150-kb 
Agilent SureSelect panel. Samples were paired-end sequenced 
(150-bp reads), using Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer with 
96 samples per lane of flow cell. The median coverage depth 
per sample across the 35 genes was >1000× per nucleotide, 
allowing the detection of mutations with variant allele fraction 
(VAF) as low as 1%. 

Primary Bioinformatics Analysis 

The paired reads of targeted sequencing are mapped to human 
genome reference (Hg38) using BWA (Burrows-Wheeler 

Aligner; http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml), duplicate 
reads are marked using picard (https://broadinstitute.github. 
io/picard/), mutations are called using genomic analysis toolkit 
(GATK; https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us) by 3 steps: 
base recalibration, haplotype caller, and variant quality score 
recalibration. Finally, mutations are annotated with databases 
ClinVar (http://www.clinvar.com/), dbSNP (https://www.ncbi. 
nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC29783/), and 1000 Genomes 
(https://www.internationalgenome.org/). 

Secondary Bioinformatics Analysis 

A quality assessment and alignment to the hg38 reference 
genome using Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies, Malaysia) 
was conducted, followed by GATK-based variant calling 
(https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us). To enrich for 
somatic variant discovery, we utilized GATK somatic caller 
Mutect2 in the tumor-only mode to locally assemble and 
align variants against the GnomAD database (https://gnomad.
broadinstitute.org), followed by the Mpileup and VarScan 
(http://www.htslib.org/) analysis to compare to Mutect2. 
Each variant was then functionally annotated using open-
source tools—SnpEff (http://pcingola.github.io/SnpEff), 
GATK-associated SAVANT, ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/clinvar), dbSNP (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp), 
OMIM (https://www.omim.org), and Ensembl (http://useast. 
ensembl.org)—to predict biological effects. 

Defining CH Mutations 

CHIP is defined by the presence of somatic mutations in 
leukemia-associated driver genes in hematopoietic stem and 
progenitor cells with the potential to expand over time, with 
VAFs of =2%.22–26 The 2% cutoff in VAF was used as it represented 
the lower limit of detection for somatic variants by 
clinically available next-generation sequencing assays.24–26 
Recently, significant advances in sequencing assays (using 
unique molecular identifiers and error-corrected sequencing) 
with higher depth coverage are now capable of detecting 
somatic mutations at VAF <0.01%. Most commonly, clinically 
relevant findings using advanced assays with high-depth 
reads have been reported at VAF =1%.27,28 

With respect to both the traditional definition of CHIP 
and increasing scientific confidence in clinically significant 
somatic mutations detected at VAF =1% with the assay used 
in the current study, we examined the presence of CHIP in 
our cohort at (1) VAF =2% and (2) performed a subanalysis 
of CH at VAF =1%.27,28 

Variants exhibited a minor allele frequency of =0.1% in 
the Exome Aggregation Consortium Project8—a database of 
known nonsomatic variants (ExAC; http://exac.broadinstitute.
org/)—and were present in the Catalogue of Somatic 
Mutations in Cancer (https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) 
database. Variants below the minor allele threshold and not 
present in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer were 
considered variants of uncertain significance. We excluded 
all variants of uncertain significance from this analysis. The 
absence of hematologic malignancy was confirmed before 
study enrollment by hematologic data and thereafter by 
patient survey. No documented hematologic malignancy was 
present among participants with CHIP at study enrollment or 
last follow-up. Details regarding hematologic characteristics 

and variant allele calling of observed CHIP and CH are 
described in Tables S1 and S2. 

Statistical Analysis 

Continuous variables that follow a normal distribution are 
expressed as mean±SD, and variables with a skewed distribution 
are expressed as mean (interquartile range). For comparison 
of quantitative variables between 2 groups, the Student 
t test was performed for normally distributed variables and 
Mann-Whitney U test (or the Kruskal-Wallis test) for non-normally 
distributed data. Variable distribution was tested using 
a Shapiro-Wilk test. Categorical variables were expressed as 
frequencies (%) and analyzed between different groups by a 
.2 test. We consistently regarded a P value <0.05 as statistically 
significant. 

A hypothesis model illustrating CH as a mediator for MACE 
in CMD is presented in Figure 1. To elucidate this relationship, 
we first examined the association between CMD and CHIP 
using a .2 test. Logistic regression was performed to assess 
the likelihood of CHIP in CMD. A multivariate Cox regression 
model adjusted for age and sex was performed to observe the 
association between both CMD and MACE. If >1 MACE was 
observed in one participant, only the first event was included 
in the regression analyses. A mediation analysis using the 
Monte Carlo method examined the association between CMD 
as an exposure, MACE as an outcome, and CHIP as a mediator 
between CMD and MACE. The relationship between CH 
and CMD was studied in the same manner. All analyses were 
performed using the STATA software (Stata Press, 2019; 
StataCorp, College Station, TX) and GraphPad Prism 9.0 
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). 

RESULTS 
Baseline Characteristics in CMD 

A total of 177 eligible participants were examined. 
Case participants with CMD defined by CFR =2 (n=19) 
were compared with controls with no CMD and CFR 
>2 (n=61). Mean follow-up was 12±7 years. Table 1 

summarizes baseline clinical, demographic, and biochemical 
characteristics between case participants with and 
without CMD. Cases with CMD were age 56±9 years 
and 68% of women, which was similar to controls (53±0 
years, P=0.230; 74% women, P=0.600). The body mass 
index in the studied cohort was significantly lower among 
those with CMD (median, 24 [22–30]) compared with 
those without CMD (median, 29 [25–32]; P=0.022). 
There was no significant difference in other traditional 
cardiovascular risk factors or lipid profiles between the 2 
groups. Measures from invasive coronary reactive testing 
in the CMD group, such as a median percentage change 
in coronary artery diameter of -13 and percentage 
change in CBF of 30, were similar when compared with 
the control group with no CMD (percentage change in 
coronary artery diameter: median, -10 [P=0.436]; percentage 
change in CBF: median, 29 [P=0.609]). 

Baseline Characteristics in CH 

CHIP was characterized by somatic mutations in 
myeloid-associated driver oncogenes in the absence 
of hematologic malignancy and was observed along a 
mutational spectrum using a sequencing assay with a 
median sample depth read 1000 per nucleotide capable 
of detecting small clones. Along this spectrum, a total of 
17 participants had CHIP at VAF =2% and 28 had CH 
at VAF =1% (Table S1). 

CHIP in CMD 

First, we examined patients with somatic mutations 
aligning with the conventional definition of CHIP at 
VAF =2% (Table 2). Mutations were most common in 
DNMT3A (n=9), TET2 (n=3), and STAG2 (n=2). Carriers 
of CHIP were older than those with no CHIP (age, 
61±2 versus 52±9; P<0.001) and mostly female (73% 
versus 76%; P=0.769). One participant had 2 mutations

in DNMT3A (Table S3). Both carriers of CHIP and those 
without CHIP had similar frequencies of cardiovascular 
comorbidities. 

A total of 27% participants with CMD had CHIP 
(versus 9% CHIP in those without CMD; P=0.028; 
Table 1). Participants with CMD were 3.86× more 
likely to have CHIP than those without CMD (odds 
ratio [OR], 4.09 [95% CI, 1.01–16.41]; P=0.048) in a 
multivariate analysis controlled for age and sex. CHIP 
in TET2 or DNMTA3 specifically did not appear more 
likely among participants with CMD compared with 
those without CMD (Table 3) and were not significantly 
more likely to experience MACE (Table S4). Using the 
Monte Carlo method to test mediation, CHIP did not 
meet statistical criteria to suggest a role in mediating 
MACE in CMD (Table S5). 

CH in CMD 

Next, smaller somatic clones at VAF =1% were considered 
cases with CH and compared with controls with no 
CH (Table 2). CH was present in a total of 28 participants. 
Mutations were commonly observed in DNMT3A 
(n=16), TET2 (n=5), PPM1D (n=3), and ASXL1 (n=2; 
Figure 2; Table S1). Three total participants had >1 
CH, including coexisting mutations in ASXL1+TET2, 
DNMT3A+DNMT3A, and DNMT3A+STAG2. Each of 
the 3 patients with >1 CH had CMD and 2 experienced 
MACE (Table S3). Participants with >1 CH were included 
only once for all analyses. 

Carriers of CH were significantly older (60±8 
versus 52±9; P<0.001) and did not have significant 
variation in sex distribution (75% versus 73%; 
P=0.839) compared with those with no CH. There 
was no significant difference in cardiovascular 
comorbidities between these 2 groups. CFR was 
significantly lower among CH carriers (2.3 [2.1–2.8] 
versus 2.8 [2.4–3.2]; P=0.001). 

CH at VAF =1% occurred in 42% of patients with 
CMD (versus 10% with CHIP; P=0.001). Those with 
CMD had CH in mostly TET2 (n=3) and DNMT3A (n=3). 
Other genes with CH in participants with CMD included 
PPM1D (n=1) and PTPN11 (n=1; Table S2). 

Regression analyses further investigated the significant 
association between CMD and CHIP. The odds of 
CH were 5× greater in those with CMD versus those 
with no CMD in a univariate logistic regression analysis 
(OR, 5.02 [95% CI, 1.58–13.89]; P=0.002). When 
age and sex were included as covariates, the odds of CH 
in CMD remained consistent (OR, 4.94 [95% CI, 1.58– 
15.44]; P=0.006; Table 4; Table S6). 

The odds of CH in the 2 most frequent genes with 
CH in CMD, TET2 and DNMT3A, were examined. Participants 
with CH in TET2 were at ˜19× greater risk 
to have CMD compared with those with no CMD (OR, 

18.82 [95% CI, 2.84–125]; P=0.002). We did not 
observe significant odds of CMD among participants 
with CH in DNMT3A (OR, 3.42 [95% CI, 0.04–0.15]; 
P=0.089; Table 4).

With a larger case group of participants with CH at VAF 
=1%, we then tested the hypothesis that CH mediates 
risk for MACE in patients with CMD. First, the association 
between MACE and both CMD and CH was tested 
with a multivariate Cox regression model (Table 5). A univariate 
analysis confirmed a 3-fold greater risk for MACE 
among participants with either CMD (hazard ratio, 3.28 
[95% CI, 1.09–9.86]; P=0.034) or CH (hazard ratio, 3.00 
[95% CI, 1.19–7.55]; P=0.020). Similarly, a multivariate 
Cox regression controlled for age and sex suggested an 

increased risk for MACE among those with CMD (hazard 
ratio, 3.89 [95% CI, 1.21–12.56]; P=0.023) and CH 
(hazard ratio, 3.03 [95% CI, 1.15–8.05]; P=0.025; Table 
S7). The risk for MACE among participants with CH was 
independent from age and sex. Kaplan-Meier curves 
illustrate the relationship between CMD versus no CMD 
and CH versus no CH with MACE (Figure 3). 

To then elucidate the role of CH in CMD and MACE, 
we utilized a conceptual model to test the hypothesis that 
CH mediates MACE in CMD. Mediation analysis by the

Monte Carlo method assessed significant full mediation 
effect of CHIP on MACE in CMD (38 units). Approximately 
32% of risk for MACE in CMD was mediated by 
CH. In other words, the mediated risk of CH was ˜0.5× 
as large as the direct effect of endothelium-independent 
CMD on MACE (Table 6). 

DISCUSSION 

The present study observes a significant relation-
ship between low CFR and the presence of CHIP in 
a unique cohort of patients with nonobstructive CAD 
and early coronary atherosclerotic injury. Additionally, 
CH appears to mediate >30% of the risk for MACE in 
patients with CMD. 

First, we confirmed a strong association between 
CHIP and coronary microvascular disease at the earliest 
stages of coronary atherosclerosis observed by 
invasive functional coronary angiography as the gold 
standard evaluation. Importantly, our findings distinguish 
a strong relationship between CHIP and low 
CFR present at the earliest atherogenesis, which has 
not yet been observed in humans. These findings add 
value to previous observations associating CHIP with 
more advanced CAD and suggest that the presence 
of CHIP precedes advanced atherosclerosis and can 

be identified in patients with the earliest detectable 
signs of coronary atherosclerotic injury. While this 
observation in coronary microvasculature is the first in 
humans, other studies continue to support an association 
between CHIP and extracoronary microvascular 
disease.15,24,29,30 Interestingly, observations in cerebrovascular 
disease support an association with CHIP and 
cerebral small vessel stroke rather than large vessel 
stroke.15,31,32 CMD is well known to precede epicardial 
CAD and is thus considered an early feature of coronary 
atherosclerosis. Our findings suggest CH mediates 
32% of the risk for MACE in patients with CMD 
in the absence of epicardial CAD. Additional studies 
would be required to determine whether the cardiovascular 
risk associated with CHIP stems from its association 
with CMD that contributes to epicardial CAD 
rather than epicardial CAD itself. 

Second, our findings suggest CH may account for 
nearly one-third of the risk for MACE in CMD. It is now 
well supported that both CMD defined by CFR =2 and 
the presence of CHIP each independently increase 
the risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes; however, 
a relationship between the two has previously been 
unknown.2,3,32–34 The present study confirms the association 
between CMD and CHIP with eventual MACE and 
identifies CH at VAF =1% as a mediator that underlies 
nearly one-third of the adverse cardiovascular outcomes 
in CMD. 

Finally, our observations associating CHIP in TET2 and 
CMD remain consistent with previous observations implicating 
CHIP in other cardiovascular disease. Regarding 
CMD, it is known hat TET2 coordinates vascular smooth 
muscle cell integrity that becomes impaired in patients 
with low CFR.35–38 Clonal expansion of somatic mutations 
in TET2 in either asymptomatic patients or among 
those with CAD have been strongly linked to risk for 
future cardiovascular events.5,39,40 Associations drawn 
from CANTOS (Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis 
Outcome Study) suggest mediating blockade 
of cytokines related to the NLRP3 (nod-like receptor

with TET2 mutations may improve cardiovascular 
outcomes.4,41 In the present study, the odds of CHIP in 
patients with CMD are ˜4-fold greater than the presence 
of CHIP in patients with no CMD and increasing 
to over 4-fold greater when CHIP is present in TET2. 
Future investigations examining the mechanistic link 
between CHIP, specifically in TET2, and vascular smooth 
muscle injury present at the earliest detectable stages of 
coronary atherosclerosis may draw conclusions to support 
screening and therapeutic recommendations in this 
unique group of patients. 

Limitations 

The current findings are presented with limitations. 
Our functional angiogram data were obtained at one 
point in time in a unique group of patients with clinically 
observed early coronary atherosclerosis that 

had not progressed to epicardial CAD. Longitudinal 
data through the progression of atherogenesis are 
needed to better understand how CHIP may contribute 
to obstructive CAD and MACE over time. Our confidence 
in identifying unique patients with CMD was, 
in part, related to using the accepted threshold of CFR 
=2 to define CMD, which limited our study group to a 
smaller number of patients. Additional findings in larger 
populations with CMD are needed to better understand 
characteristics of patients with CMD and CHIP. 
Regarding CHIP, we accepted the traditional threshold 
of VAF =2% that was originally used to define CHIP in 
early studies.23 However, it is important to note recently 
published studies that begin to provide significant clinical 
evidence associated with CHIP defined by a VAF 
threshold of =1% with the use of modern sequencing 
assays.27 We acknowledge this evolution in technology 
and scientific evidence and performed analyses using 
2 groups of patients with CHIP with respective VAF at

either =2% and considered CH a distinct group at VAF 
=1%. Findings in both groups were similar and further 
suggest a strong association between CMD and both 
CHIP and CH. More patients in the group of patients 
with CH at VAF =1% provided more meaningful and 
significant data to support evidence to suggest that 
CH mediates the risk for MACE in CMD. Reported CIs 
became wider in smaller groups of studied patients. 
Ultimately, larger studies in diverse patient groups are 
needed to determine additional associations between 
CHIP across a larger spectrum of VAF and CMD in 
patients with CMD at the early stages of coronary 
atherogenesis. 

Conclusions 

In summary, in humans, we utilized invasive functional 
coronary angiogram to confirm an association between 
CHIP and CMD in the absence of obstructive CAD. The 
presence of CH mediates nearly one-third of the risk for 
adverse cardiovascular outcomes in CMD. Future studies 
are needed to elucidate the risk-enhancing role of CHIP 
in CMD and early CAD.
