Introduction
Bacterial meningitis (BM) is a rare infection that can be complicated by severe sequelae [1]. Infection occurs among patients of all ages, who may have premorbid health conditions, in both community and healthcare settings [2]. Most patients have a single episode; rarely, the infection is recurrent [3]. Community-acquired BM (CBM) is distinct from healthcare-associated BM (HBM). HBM has recently been associated with healthcare facilities (HBMF), such as hospitals or nursing homes, and with clinical procedures resulting in post-neurosurgical infection, with or without an implanted, indwelling intracranial device [4-6]. Vaccines targeting BM-causing pathogens have been introduced in several countries. In Sweden, the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) was introduced into the childhood vaccination program in 1993, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) were launched nationally in 2009. The effects of vaccine introduction on BM and its severe sequelae remain to be determined, and patient groups with an increased risk of BM need to be identified for preventive measures. During the conjugate vaccine era, overall age-specific survival in Sweden has increased, in part due to new medical treatments for chronic diseases [7-9].

Here, we studied the incidence and aetiology of BM, and its associated premorbid conditions, 30-day mortality and risk factors for severe sequelae among patients with BM over 50 years in Sweden. Additionally, the importance of specific predisposing conditions for recurrent BM (RBM) was investigated.

Methods
Data collection
We performed a 50-year population-based cohort study with national coverage of BM in Sweden. Patients diagnosed with pathogen-specified BM prospectively reported to the National Patient Register (NPR) using the Swedish version of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 7–10 were identified from the registers of the National Board of Health and Welfare. Data, including their aetiologic pathogens, date of birth, admission, discharge, death, migration, severe sequelae, clinical setting and premorbid conditions, were collected. The NPR contains Swedish inpatient data from 1964 onwards, with national coverage from 1987. National Swedish registers for open specialist care (2001 onwards) and pharmacology (July 2005 onwards) provided complementary information regarding severe sequelae and pharmacological pre-admission treatment, respectively, for patients diagnosed after these dates. This study was approved by the Uppsala local ethics committee.

Definitions
BM was defined as an episode of pathogen-specified BM identifiable using ICD 9/10 codes, as used in Swedish health care from 1987 onwards. The ICD codes were provided by the attending physicians and bacteria were mainly detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. Detailed definitions of age groups, Charlson comorbidities, risk factors for BM, pharmacological immunosuppression, HBM and pathogens, including ICD codes and classification as specific predisposing conditions, are available in the Supplementary Information (Materials and Methods, Tables S1 and S2). To minimise potential bias due to different ICD versions, coding practices and subnational coverage, no statistical analyses were performed on patient data from before 1987. To further test data validity, we collected 46 medical records of consecutive BM episodes from different Swedish hospitals (Table S3). RBM was defined as a subsequent separate BM episode with the same or different pathogens as in the index episode. Detailed definitions of the RBM are available in the Supplementary Information, Materials and Methods. Severe sequelae were defined as death within 30 days or new severe neurological sequelae in hospitals within either 90 days of admission, for acute cerebrovascular events, or 1 year of admission, for other severe neurological sequelae (hydrocephalus, epilepsy, paresis of one or more limbs, loss of vision and/or other cranial nerve dysfunctions excluding hearing impairment, sensorineural hearing impairment, depression with antidepressant pharmacological treatment, moderate and severe anxiety or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) [1, 10, 11]. Pharmacological data were available from 2005 onwards only; therefore, data on severe sequelae were restricted to episodes reported thereafter. Detailed definitions of severe sequelae and disease burden are provided in the Supplementary Information.

Statistical analysis
Logistic regression was used to analyse categorical data. Negative binomial regression with robust estimation of standard errors was used to analyse count data and for survival analysis with clustering of patients, as previously described [12-14]. The incidence rates for BM were calculated using age-specific data on the midyear population from Statistics Sweden. Average percentage changes were derived through exponentiation of the regression coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals from the regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA16.

Results
Patient characteristics and aetiology of BM
A total of 10,771 episodes of BM met the inclusion criteria from 1965 to 2014. Thirty-six percent (3859/10,771) of all episodes occurred in children under 5 years, of which 8% (303/3859) were neonatal cases. Fifty-five percent (5894/10,771) were adults (≥18 years), among whom the elderly (≥65 years) constituted 38% (2233/5894), corresponding to 21% (2233/10,771) of all patients (Table 1). Fifty-three percent were females (5673/10,771). The most common bacterial cause of BM during the period 1965–2014 was Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococci, 34%), followed by Haemophilus influenzae (Haemophilus, 26%), Neisseria meningitidis (meningococci, 18%), Staphylococcus spp. (staphylococci, 9%), non-pneumococcal streptococci (streptococci, 8%), Listeria monocytogenes (Listeria, 3%) and gram-negative bacteria, excluding Haemophilus and meningococci (1%) (Table 1). In 0.4% of the cases (40/10,771), multiple species were found. Aetiology differed between the age groups. In the youngest children (0–4 years), Haemophilus was the most prominent cause, found in 56% (2172/3859), followed by pneumococci (17%, n = 669), meningococci (13%, n = 508) and streptococci (9%, n = 365). In contrast, among the elderly, pneumococci dominated, with 48% (2835/5894), followed by meningococci (15%), staphylococci (14%), streptococci (8%), Haemophilus (7%) and Listeria (5%).

Temporal trends of BM and the effects of conjugate vaccines
The BM incidence increased in children under 5 years from 1970 to 1980 and remained constant until the beginning of the 1990s, when it decreased dramatically (Fig. 1). Haemophilus was the dominant agent; however, after 1993, when the Hib vaccine was introduced, there were few Hib cases. The incidence of meningococci was also high between 1965 and the mid-1970s in young children, but decreased thereafter, despite the absence of a meningococcal vaccine in the vaccination program (Fig. 1 and Figs S1 and S2). The incidence of episodes caused by gram-negative bacteria and streptococci was also most prominent in young children, and there were increases in neonatal BM (annual change 6%, 95% confidence interval [CI95%] 1%–11%, p = 0.01) and neonatal gram-negative BM (annual change 23%, CI95% 9%–39%, p = 0.001) during the conjugate-vaccine era (Table 1, Fig. S3). Overall, E. coli was the most common gram-negative bacterium among neonates (28/34), in contrast to Pseudomonas, which was mainly found in adults (12/14) (Table S4), Listeria infections were predominantly found in the elderly (208/349, 60%) and were practically absent among neonates (Table 1). The incidence of BM episodes caused by staphylococci, Listeria and gram-negative bacteria increased from 0.4 to 0.6 per 100,000 person-years (incidence rate ratio 1.8, CI95% 1.5–2.1, p < 0.001), corresponding to an increase among BM cases from 8% (150/1832) to 26% (299/1136) (odds ratio [OR] 4.0, CI95% 3.2–5.0, p < 0.001) when comparing the period 1987–1991 with 2010–2014. The incidence of pneumococcal meningitis was highest in children under 5 years, at 5.1 per 100,000 person-years prevaccination (2004–2008), which decreased after introduction of the first PCV, PCV7, to 1.5 in the post-vaccination period (2009–2014) (percentage change after vaccination −70%, CI95% −82 to −49, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1, Table 2).

CBM and HBM
CBM constituted 86% (9211/10,771) of the episodes (Table 1). Most of the episodes caused by Haemophilus (97%), meningococci (95%), pneumococci (90%), Listeria (69%) and streptococci (63%) were CBM. Pneumococci, Haemophilus and meningococci constituted 36%, 30% and 20%, respectively, of the CBM episodes (Table 1). The most common aetiology among CBM episodes post-PCV in children was meningococcal infection (36%, 60/165), while pneumococci still dominated in adults (54%, 388/719) despite a reduced overall incidence of pneumococcal CBM episodes (−20%, CI95% −30 to −10, p = 0.001) (Fig. 2, Table 2, Fig. S1). HBM was observed in 1560/10,771 (14%) episodes (Table 1). Here, staphylococci dominated (30%), followed by pneumococci (24%) and streptococci (21%). Pneumococcal infection was the most common aetiology among HBMF episodes post-PCV in both non-neonatal children (36%, 15/42) and adults (33%, 66/201) (Table S5). HBMF episodes increased somewhat during the conjugate-vaccine era (Figs S1 and S2). Among the associated clinical settings, nursing homes provided the highest proportion of Listeria (11%) (Table 1). Post-neurosurgical BM was the least prevalent healthcare-associated form (Table 1). Post-PCV, the most common aetiology among post-neurosurgical episodes in both children (61%, 14/23) and adults (44%, 53/121) was staphylococcal infection, but the incidence of pneumococcal post-neurosurgical BM increased (106%, CI95% 2–319, p < 0.05) (Table S5, Table 2, Figs S1 and S2). Again post-PCV, gram-negative bacteria were more common among post-neurosurgical episodes with an indwelling device present (23%, 9/39) than in those without (6%, 6/105) (Table S5).

Premorbid conditions in patients with BM
Premorbid conditions were found in 20% (2157/10,771) of all the BM episodes (Table 1). The most common immunosuppressive premorbid conditions, in descending order, were traumatic, cerebrovascular and neoplastic lesions of the central nervous system (CNS) in 30% (652/2157), malignant neoplasia in 30% (641/2157) and rheumatic disease in 11% (241/2157). Premorbid conditions were most frequently found in patients infected with Listeria (58%), staphylococci (53%), gram-negative bacteria (45%), multiple microbes (38%), non-pneumococcal streptococci (24%) and pneumococci (24%) (Table 1). Following the introduction of the Hib vaccine, the incidence of BM patients with comorbidities increased (annual change 3%, CI95% 3–4, p < 0.001); at the end of the study period, there were more adult BM patients with immunosuppression than without previous morbidities (Fig. 2). Among the episodes caused by pneumococci, the most common premorbid condition was malignant neoplasia 31% (277/889). Cerebrovascular lesions and basilar skull fractures constituted 9% (81/889) and 7% (65/889), respectively, of pneumococcal episodes (Table 1). Malignant neoplasia in adults was most common in CBM caused by Listeria, followed by that caused by gram-negative bacteria; the corresponding pathogens for children were staphylococci, followed by gram-negative bacteria (Fig. S4). Adult patients infected with Listeria had the highest proportions of older age group individuals, rheumatic disease, and malignant neoplasia, while cerebrovascular lesions were most prevalent among adult patients with gram-negative meningitis (Fig. S4). However, staphylococci were dominant in patients with a tumour or CNS haemorrhage (Table 1). Among the polymicrobial episodes, the most prevalent form of specific immunosuppression was malignant neoplasia 15% (6/40) (Table 1).

In total, 6% (670/10,771) of BM episodes occurred in RBM patients and 80% of these (538/670) were first and second episodes. The majority were caused by pneumococci (57%, 381/670) and most occurred in the community (82%, 547/670) (Table S6). RBM was observed in 23% (9/40) of the episodes that occurred in adult patients with polymicrobial aetiology (Tables 1 and S6). After the introduction of ICD-10 codes in 1997, primary immunodeficiencies and neurosurgical, traumatic, cerebrovascular and neoplastic lesions of the CNS were associated with RBM, and the recurrence rate increased over time (relative risk 1.1, CI95% 1.1–1.2, p < 0.001) (Tables 3 and S7).

Risk factors for severe sequelae and the disease burden of BM
After 2004, the overall rate of severe sequelae following single-episode BM was 44% (917/2084), and patients on average lost 11 years of healthy life due to BM (Tables S8 and S9). The risk of severe sequelae was higher among adults (49%, 788/1602) than children (27%, 129/482) (OR 2.6, CI95% 2.1–3.3, p < 0.001), and higher in the post-neurosurgical setting (67%, 123/183) than in the non-neurosurgical setting (42%, 794/1901) (OR 2.9, CI95% 2.1–3.9, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3, Table S8). The highest severe sequelae rates were found among patients with staphylococcal (62%, 179/287), polymicrobial (50%, 5/10) and pneumococcal (47%, 425/905) infections (Table S8). The rate of neurological sequelae was 36% (746/2084), with a higher rate in adults (39%, 632/1602) than in children (24%, 114/482) (OR 2.1, CI95% 1.7–2.7, p < 0.001), and higher in the post-neurosurgical setting (63%, 116/183) than in the non-neurosurgical setting (33%, 630/1901) (OR 3.5, CI95% 2.5–4.8, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3, Table S8). The rate of nonpsychological neurological sequelae was 28% (588/2084) and the rate of psychological sequelae was 13% (261/2084). The rate of nonstructural neurological sequelae was 29% (607/2084) as compared to 11% (232/2084) for structure-altering neurological sequelae, most commonly hydrocephalus (6%, 129/2084), followed by cerebrovascular lesions (6%, 117/2084) (Fig. S5). Hydrocephalus was more common in episodes caused by staphylococci (OR 9.2, CI95% 6.1–13.9, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). In the non-neurosurgical setting, there was no association between HBMF and severe sequelae (OR 1.0, CI95% 0.8–1.3, p = 0.76) (Table S10).

All-cause 30-day mortality due to BM
The overall 30-day mortality of BM was 9% (981/10,771); it was 3% in children and 14% in adults, with a decreasing trend since 1987 in adults, particularly among the elderly (annual change −2%, CI95% −4 to −1, p < 0.001), but also among nonvaccinated adults (annual change −3%, CI95% −5 to −2, p < 0.001) (Fig. S6). The same trend was observed for pneumococcal BM, with a decreasing trend in mortality overall (annual change −3%, CI95% −5 to −2, p < 0.001) in the CBM setting (annual change −3%, CI95% −5 to −2, p < 0.001) and in adults since 1987, especially among the elderly (annual change −4%, CI95% −6 to −2, p < 0.001) (Figs S6 and S7). When comparing the pneumococcal episodes from 5 years before and after PCV introduction, mortality was reduced in children (no deaths post-PCV) and in adults with comorbidities (−64%, −83 to −27, p = 0.005), as well as in adults ≤65 years (−65%, −86 to −16, p = 0.02) (Table 2). From the year 2005 onwards, the overall 30-day mortality of BM was 10% (205/2084), with a higher rate in adults (12%, 189/1602) than in children (3%, 16/482) (OR 3.9, CI95% 2.3–6.6, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). The mortality rate was higher among immunosuppressed patients (OR 1.5, CI95%, 1.1–2.0, p = 0.009), and one third of all fatalities in children were neonates (Table S8, Fig. 3). In the non-neurosurgical setting, there was an association between older age (≥65 years) and mortality (adjusted OR 8.7, CI95% 3.7–20.3, p < 0.001) (Table S10).

Discussion
BM is a devastating disease carrying a risk of death and severe neurological sequelae among survivors. To develop effective treatment and preventive strategies, we need knowledge on incidence trends, aetiology and risk factors over the long term. In this unique national population-based study, we examined BM over 50 years in Sweden using national registries. We found that the incidence of BM decreased dramatically in young children after the introduction of conjugated vaccines into the childhood vaccination program, leading to changes in the aetiology of BM during the study period, which varied with age group. The most dramatic decrease was observed following the introduction of the Hib vaccine in 1993, in accordance with previous studies [15]. The incidence of Hib has remained low since then, probably because nonvaccine-type strains have not expanded to any great extent in healthy carriers [16]. The incidence of pneumococcal BM also decreased after PCV introduction but not in nonvaccinated adults, which is in agreement with earlier studies showing a limited impact of PCVs on invasive pneumococcal disease in this age group [17, 18]. This limited effect is probably influenced by the observed replacement in carriage during childhood of vaccine-type strains with nonvaccine type strains, which may spread to susceptible individuals, such as nonvaccinated adults [19]. Nonvaccine types have, in previous studies, appeared less capable of causing invasive diseases, including BM, in previously healthy individuals; they primarily affect the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, and generate a milder disease course [18-20]. We found that the incidence of meningococcal meningitis has decreased since the mid-1970s, particularly in young children, even though a general meningococcal vaccination was not introduced. The same trend has been observed in other European countries, including Finland, and several mechanisms have been proposed [21]. The incidences of neonatal BM and BM caused by pathogens associated with post-neurosurgical BM, Staphylococcus spp. and gram-negative bacteria were in accordance with those found in previous studies [22, 23].

We also showed that during the conjugate-vaccine era, the incidence of BM in patients with immunosuppression surpassed that of BM in previously healthy individuals. At the same time, the proportion of pathogens associated with immunosuppression (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus spp., gram-negative bacteria) and RBM increased. These trends are probably the result of demographic changes, including increased age-specific survival among adults [7-9]. In line with previous findings, we found that several neoplastic, cerebrovascular and traumatic CNS lesions associated with blood–brain barrier dysfunction are risk factors for acquiring BM [3, 24-30].

Importantly, the overall mortality was 9%, and this decreased during the study period (1987–2014) in the elderly and unvaccinated adults, while it remained low in children (3%). At the beginning of the study period (1987–1991), the all-cause 30-day mortality among adult patients with BM was 16% (126/780); towards the end of the study period (2010–2014), it was 9% (85/910) (OR 0.5, CI95% 0.4–0.7; p < 0.001). Mortality due to pneumococcal BM decreased during the study period, from 18% (94/524) at the beginning of the study period to 9% (42/466) by the end of the study period (OR 0.5, CI95% 0.3–0.7; p < 0.001). Post-PCV, a decrease was observed among children, comorbid adults and the elderly. Moreover, severe sequelae were present in 44% of the patients with BM, and the highest rates were found among patients with staphylococcal (62%) and pneumococcal (47%) infections. Thus, despite decreased incidence and improved prognosis, we found that BM patients, on average, lost about 11 years of healthy life, and pneumococcal BM takes the highest toll. These data show similar patterns to those seen in previous studies, but with slightly higher rates [21, 31]. Furthermore, we showed that age, pathogen and immunocompetence, including prior neurosurgery, are important prognostic indicators for BM. However, in a non-neurosurgical setting, patient age, rather than premorbid conditions or recent association with a healthcare facility, is of prognostic value. When considering initial empiric treatment in a patient with suspected BM, factors associated with opportunistic or resistant bacteria, such as immunosuppression, older age or recent hospital or nursing home care, are also important.

This study has several strengths but its limitations should also be considered. The study period was long, at 50 years; the source has national coverage and includes culture-negative episodes. Random erroneous reporting would result only in nondifferential misclassification, and the comorbidity data have been shown to be highly valid [32]. The Swedish setting, with a tax-financed healthcare system and unique individual numbers assigned to citizens at birth and to immigrants at contact with the healthcare system, allows for data tracking. NPR coverage has increased gradually from only a few hospitals in 1965 to near national coverage in 1975; thus, data from prior to 1975 should be interpreted with caution. We found no evidence of changes in data quality from 1987 onwards; thus, only data from this period were retained for the analysis. The medical records of 46 consecutive episodes of pneumococcal BM with 1 year of follow-up data from hospital admittance were retrieved from selected Swedish secondary and tertiary care hospitals from 2005 to 2014, and we found consistency between the reported registry data and original medical records (Supplementary Information, Materials and Methods, Fig. S2).

We conclude that this national study provides important information on BM and its consequences, with a decreasing incidence in younger age groups in the post-vaccination era, but with changes in aetiology and patient characteristics. Conjugated vaccines have reduced the number of BM cases caused by pneumococci and H. influenzae, but BM caused by meningococci has also decreased, even though no vaccine has been introduced against this pathogen. This information is relevant for future strategies to treat and prevent this severe infection.
