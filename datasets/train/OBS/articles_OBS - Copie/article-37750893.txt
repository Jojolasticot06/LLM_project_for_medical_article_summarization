Introduction 

Type 2 diabetes is an independent risk factor for CVD, which 
is a major cause of death [1]. Given that the main cause 
of diabetic complications is damage to tissues and organs 
caused by persistent hyperglycaemia [2], achieving optimal 
glycaemic control is important to prevent the development 
and progression of CVD in people with this condition. 

HbA1c is the gold standard for assessing glycaemic control. 
Current guidelines developed by the ADA, the EASD 
and the Japan Diabetes Society have set an HbA1c control 
target of less than 7% (53 mmol/mol) for optimal diabetes 
management [3–6]. However, the ADA and EASD guidelines 
specify that HbA1c has a number of limitations [6, 7]. 
While some studies have demonstrated strong associations 
between HbA1c levels and diabetic complications [8, 9], several 
large clinical trials have failed to show that intensive 
glycaemic control based on HbA1c has beneficial effects on 

CVD onset in people with type 2 diabetes [10–12]. This is 
most likely because HbA1c does not provide information on 
all glycaemic abnormalities that may play an important role 
in the development of CVD, such as glucose variability [13] 
and hypoglycaemia [14], although to our knowledge no prospective 
intervention studies have examined the relationship 
between glucose variability and CVD. Continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM) has emerged as the optimal method to 
obtain a comprehensive glycaemic profile that includes such 
data. In particular, the consensus report by ADA and EASD 
recommended that assessments of glycaemic control include 
not only HbA1c measurement but also time in range (TIR), 
defined as the percentage of the time spent within the target 
glucose range, because TIR is a useful metric of glycaemic 
control [6, 7]. 

Importantly, a recent cohort study in 6225 people with 
diabetes demonstrated that lower TIR assessed by CGM during 
hospitalisation was associated with an increased risk of 
all-cause and CVD mortality during a median follow-up of 

6.9 years [15]. In addition, cross-sectional studies have demonstrated 
that TIR and/or glucose variability metrics are significantly 
associated with carotid artery intima–media thickening 
[16], the tissue characteristics of the carotid artery 
wall [17] and arterial stiffness [18, 19]. However, the association 
of TIR and glucose variability metrics with the progression 
of atherosclerosis has not yet been fully elucidated. 
Carotid ultrasonography is a simple, non-invasive 
and inexpensive procedure for assessing the severity of 

atherosclerosis [20], while non-invasive ultrasonic tissue 
characterisation of the carotid artery wall or plaque using 
the grey-scale median (GSM) reflects vascular composition 
[21]. Lesions containing abundant lipids and haemorrhagic 
components are more echolucent (lower GSM), whereas stable 
components, including fibrous and calcified tissue, are 
more echogenic (higher GSM). A previous study demonstrated 
that people with type 2 diabetes had more echolucent 
plaques than those without the condition [22]. In addition, 
a recent study indicated that people with type 2 diabetes 
were at higher risk of CVD if they had low GSM plaques 
than if they did not [23]. Also, we recently showed that the 
change in mean GSM over time was useful for predicting 
CVD events in people with type 2 diabetes [24]. 

In this exploratory study, we investigated the relation-
ship of TIR and glucose variability metrics with changes in 
carotid atherosclerosis, including intime–media thickness 
(IMT) and the tissue characteristics of the carotid artery 
wall, in people with type 2 diabetes with no apparent history 
of symptomatic CVD. 

Methods 

Study design This study was an exploratory sub-analysis 
of an ongoing observational, prospective cohort study 
investigating the relationships between glucose fluctuations 
evaluated using CGM and the incidence of composite 
cardiovascular events over a 5-year follow-up period [25]. 
The primary aim of this study was to assess the relationship 
between TIR and CV at baseline, and changes in IMT and 
GSM over 104 weeks, with adjustment for conventional risk 
factors. The secondary aim was to assess the association 
of other CGM-derived metrics and HbA1c with changes in 
IMT and GSM. This study used cohort study data obtained 
at baseline and at 104 weeks. This study has been registered 
in the University Hospital Medical Information Network 
Clinical Trials Registry, which is a non-profit organisation 
in Japan that meets the requirements of the International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors (UMIN000032325). 

Study population The study population consisted of Japanese 
people with type 2 diabetes who regularly attend the 
outpatient diabetes clinics of 34 institutions across Japan. 
The study design, inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria 
have been published previously [25] and are described in 
electronic supplementary material (ESM) Methods. Briefly, 
the study enrolled outpatients aged =30 years and =80 years 
who were on a stable glucose-lowering treatment regimen, 
defined as no changes in glucose-lowering medications 
(including new prescriptions) for 6 months before written 
informed consent was obtained, and with no anticipated 
changes in glucose-lowering medication from the time of 

enrolment until the application of CGM sensors. Insulin 
dose changes were allowed. People with a history of symptomatic 
cardiovascular events were excluded. Information 
on how representative this study sample was of the larger 
population of interest in terms of age, sex, ethnicity, regional 
and socioeconomic factors was not available. Sex and race/ 
ethnicity were self-reported. 

Consecutive people attending the clinic were screened. 
People who met the eligibility criteria were asked to 
participate in the present study. A total of 1000 people 
who met the eligibility criteria were recruited between 
May 2018 and March 2019. One person withdrew consent. 
Among the 999 participants, 600 for whom baseline 
carotid ultrasound images were obtained were included 
in this analysis. The protocol was approved by the institutional 
review board of each participating institution in 
compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and current 
legal regulations in Japan. Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants after a full explanation of 
the study. 

Biochemical tests Blood samples were obtained after 
overnight fasting. Renal function, lipid levels and HbA1c 
(standardised according to the National Glycohaemoglobin 
Standardisation Program) were measured using standard techniques. 
Urinary albumin excretion was measured by a latex 
agglutination assay using a spot urine sample. The eGFR was 
calculated using a previously defined formula [26]. 

Continuous glucose monitoring using the FreeStyle Libre 
Pro The FreeStyle Libre Pro CGM (FLP-CGM) device 
(Abbott Japan), which measures glucose levels every 15 
min for up to 14 days, was used at baseline as previously 
reported [18, 25] and at 104 weeks. Other than wearing 
the FLP-CGM, there were no restrictions on participants’ 
daily lives. Downloaded datasets were analysed. Glucose 
variability was assessed based on the glucose CV [7]. CV 
(%) was calculated by dividing the SD by the mean of 
the corresponding glucose readings. TIR was defined as 
the percentage of time within the target range of 3.9–10.0 
mmol/l. Time above range (TAR) >10 and >13.9 mmol/l 
(TAR>10 mmol/l and TAR>13.9 mmol/l) were defined as the percentages 
of time above the corresponding blood glucose 
levels. Time below range (TBR) <3.9 and <3.0 mmol/l 
(TBR<3.9 mmol/l and TBR<3.0 mmol/l) were defined as the percentages 
of time below the corresponding blood glucose 
levels [7]. Mean glucose, CV, TIR, TAR and TBR are 
among the primary measurable outcomes of CGM [27]. 
As a previous study demonstrated that FLP-CGM was less 
accurate during the first 24 h after insertion (from the first 
day to the second day) and during the last 4 days of its 
14-day lifetime [28], we analysed FLP-CGM data obtained 
over the middle 8-day period. 

Measurement of carotid IMT Ultrasonographic scans of the 
carotid artery were performed by expert sonographers who 
had been specifically trained to perform the prescribed study 
examination using the same equipment in each setting, as 
reported previously [29, 30]. Briefly, the extracranial common 
carotid artery (CCA), the carotid bulb and the internal carotid 
artery in the neck were scanned bilaterally in transverse projections 
and at least three different longitudinal projections; 
in addition, the site of greatest thickness, including plaque 
lesions, was identified along the arterial walls. The IMT represents 
the distance between two parallel echogenic lines corresponding 
to the vascular lumen and the adventitia. To avoid 
inter-reader variability, all scans were electronically stored 
and emailed to the central office (IMT Evaluation Committee, 
Osaka, Japan) to be read in random order by a single experienced 
reader who was blinded to the clinical characteristics 
of the participants, using Intimascope automated digital edgedetection 
software (MediaCross, Japan) [29, 30]. The software 
system calculates the mean of approximately 200 IMT 
values in the segment that is 2 cm proximal to the dilation of 
the carotid bulb (mean IMT-CCA), and CCA-max-IMT was 
defined as the higher of the right and left values. 

The echogenicity of the arterial wall was evaluated based 
on the GSM method, with a grey-scale range of 0–255 
(where 0 is the darkest tone and 255 is the brightest), as 

described previously [17]. Adobe Photoshop software version 
7.0 (Adobe Systems, USA) was used for image standardisation 
and calculation of grey-scale values. The methods 
used for GSM measurement are shown in detail in Fig. 1. 

The annual change in each value was calculated as (final 
value - initial value)/observation period. The intra-reader 
CVs for mean IMT, CCA-max-IMT and GSM measurements 
were 2.0%, 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively, for 40 consecutively 
replicated measurements [17]. 

Statistical analysis The results are presented as mean ± SD 
or median (IQR) for continuous variables, and as number 
(proportion) of patients for categorical variables. Changes 
from baseline to 104 weeks were assessed using the onesample 
t test and Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test for continuous 
variables, and McNemar’s test for categorical variables. 
A pre-specified multivariate linear regression analysis was 
performed to investigate whether FLP-CGM-derived metrics 
were associated with changes in index values for carotid 
atherosclerosis, which included mean IMT-CCA, CCA-max-
IMT, mean GSM and thickened-lesion GSM. The model 
included the following pre-specified conventional risk factors 
[18, 31]: age, sex, index values for carotid atherosclerosis, 
BMI, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, systolic BP, total cholesterol, 
HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, uric acid, eGFR, 


Fig. 1 Methods of GSM evaluation. Standardisation of the B-mode 
image was performed using a curve option, so that the GSM for blood 
ranged from 0 to 5 and that for the adventitia ranged from 185 to 

195. (a) The right and left mean IMT areas (intima–media complex 
of the segment 2 cm proximal to dilation of the carotid bulb) were 
then delineated using a freehand tool (red frame), and the GSM of 
the selected area was read from the entire delineated area. The mean 
GSM was defined as the average of the right and left values. (b) Ifthere were atherosclerotic thickened lesions (focal IMT =1.0 mm), 
the GSM of these lesions was measured using the same method in 
the right and left arteries. We defined these atherosclerotic thickened 
lesions as ‘carotid plaque’. The lesions were delineated using a freehand 
tool (red frame), and the GSM value of each carotid plaque was 
read from the entire delineated area. If multiple thickened lesions 
were found in the same individual, the lesion with the greatest thickness 
was subjected to GSM measurement separately in the left and 
right carotids, and then the lower of the right and left values, defined 
as ‘thickened-lesion GSM’, was used as the representative value 

urinary albumin excretion, presence of diabetic retinopathy, 
smoking status, alcohol consumption, use of insulin therapy, 
use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and/ 
or angiotensin II receptor blockers, use of statins and use 
of anti-platelet agents at baseline [32–37]. The Hochberg 
method was used to control multiple testing [38] as a post 
hoc analysis. 

Next, we performed a pre-specified sensitivity analysis 
to investigate the relationship between FLP-CGM-derived 
metrics and the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Participants 
were divided into three groups based on tertiles of 
FLP-CGM-derived metrics at baseline. Trend association 
across these groups was evaluated by linear regression analysis 
adjusted for age, sex and each index value for carotid 
atherosclerosis at baseline. 

Finally, we performed a post hoc sensitivity analysis to 
investigate how atherosclerosis progression was affected 
by achieving target CGM-derived metrics proposed by an 
international consensus [27]. To do this, we classified participants 
into two groups: those who did or did not achieve 
all target CGM-derived metrics at baseline: TIR >70%, TAR

>10 mmol/l <25%, TAR>13.9 mmol/l <5%, TBR<3.9 mmol/l <4% and 

TBR<3.0 mmol/l <1%. Comparison between the two groups 
was performed using a linear regression model adjusted for 
potential conventional risk factors for atherosclerosis. 

All statistical tests were two-sided with a 5% significance 
level. All analyses were performed using SAS software version 
9.4 (SAS Institute, USA). 

Results 

Participants’ demographic and background characteristics, 
and changes in clinical parameters during the study 
period The data of 600 participants with type 2 diabetes 
were available at baseline. Forty-seven participants did not 
undergo carotid ultrasonography at 104 weeks: 35 were 
lost to follow-up and 12 refused to undergo the examination. 
The baseline clinical characteristics of the 600 participants 
are summarised in Table 1. The mean age was 
64.9±9.2 years, 63.2% were male, and the mean HbA1c was 
7.0±0.8% (53.5±9.0 mmol/mol). Over 104 weeks of followup, 
HbA1c was not significantly changed, and there was a 
modest but significant increase in CV. With respect to other 
conventional atherosclerotic risk factors, BMI was slightly 
decreased, and renal function was slightly deteriorated, as 
determined by eGFR. The frequency of use of oral glucoselowering 
agents, anti-hypertensive agents, statins and antiplatelet 
agents increased significantly during the 104-week 
study period. 

A modest but significant increase in mean IMT was 
observed over 104 weeks, but there was no significant 

change in CCA-max-IMT. The annual changes in mean IMT 
and CCA-max-IMT were 0.008±0.046 and 0.004±0.128 
mm/year, respectively. For GSM, a modest but significant 
increase in thickened-lesion GSM was observed over 104 
weeks, but there was no significant change in mean GSM. 
The annual changes in mean GSM and thickened-lesion 
GSM were 0.48±6.63 and 5.3±11.6 units/year, respectively. 

Relationship between CV and TIR at baseline, and changes 
in IMT and GSM The primary aim of this study was to use 
multivariate linear regression analysis to assess the relation-
ship between CV and TIR at baseline, and changes in IMT 
and GSM over 104 weeks. CV and TIR were not associated 
with the annual changes in mean IMT or CCA-max-IMT 
(Table 2). However, CV and TIR were significantly associated 
with the annual changes in mean GSM and thickenedlesion 
GSM (Table 3). As CV at baseline increased by 1%, 
mean GSM decreased by 0.12 units/year. As TIR at baseline 
increased by 10%, mean GSM increased by 0.52 units/year. 
Similarly, as CV at baseline increased by 1%, thickenedlesion 
GSM decreased by 0.19 units/year. As TIR at baseline 
increased by 10%, thickened-lesion GSM increased by 0.95 
units/year. 

Association of FLP-CGM-derived metrics and HbA1c at baseline 
with changes in IMT and GSM The secondary aim of 
this study was to use multivariate linear regression analysis 
to assess the relationship between other FLP-CGM-derived 
metrics, which included mean glucose, TAR>10 mmol/l, 
TBR<3.9 mmol/l and HbA1c at baseline, and changes in IMT 
and GSM over 104 weeks. Neither FLP-CGM-derived metrics 
nor HbA1c were associated with changes in mean IMT, 
CCA-max-IMT, mean GSM or thickened-lesion GSM after 
adjusting for multiple testing (Table 4). 

Relationship between FLP-CGM-derived metrics and 
changes in index values for carotid atherosclerosis Next, 
we performed a pre-defined sensitivity analysis to investi-
gate the relationship between FLP-CGM-derived metrics 
and the progression of carotid atherosclerosis. Participants 
were divided into three groups based on tertiles of FLPCGM-
derived metrics at baseline. There was no significant 
association between FLP-CGM-derived metrics classified 
by tertiles and the annual changes in mean IMT and CCAmax-
IMT in a linear regression model adjusted for age, sex 
and each IMT value at baseline (ESM Table 1). In a linear 
regression model adjusted for age, sex and mean GSM at 
baseline, lower CV and higher TIR classified by tertiles were 
significantly associated with an annual increase in mean 
GSM (ESM Table 1). Also, in a linear regression model 
adjusted for age, sex and thickened-lesion GSM at baseline, 
lower mean glucose, CV, TAR>13.9 mmol/l and higher TIR 
classified by tertiles were significantly associated with an

The model included age, sex and index values for carotid atherosclerosis at baseline, BMI, duration ofdiabetes, HbA1c, systolic BP, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, logarithm of triacylglycerols, serum uricacid, eGFR, logarithm of urinary albumin excretion, presence of diabetic retinopathy, smoking status (neversmoker, previous smoker, or current smoker), alcohol consumption, use of insulin therapy, use of angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, use of statins and use of antiplatelet 
agents. The presence of diabetic retinopathy (including simple diabetic retinopathy, pre-proliferativediabetic retinopathy and proliferative diabetic retinopathy) was determined based on medical records 

annual increase in thickened-lesion GSM (ESM Table 1). 
However, no significant association was observed between 
HbA1c values classified by tertile and the annual changes in 
all index values for carotid atherosclerosis (ESM Table 1). 

Relationship between changes in FLP-CGM-derived metrics 
and changes in index values for carotid atherosclerosis We 
performed a pre-specified exploratory analysis to investi-
gate the relationship between changes in FLP-CGM-derived 
metrics from baseline to 104 weeks and the progression of 
carotid atherosclerosis over 104 weeks. There were no significant 
relationships between changes in FLP-CGM-derived 
metrics and the annual changes in any of the index values 
for carotid atherosclerosis (ESM Table 2). In addition, in 
adjusted linear regression models, no significant association 
was observed between changes in FLP-CGM-derived metrics 
and the annual changes in these values (ESM Tables 3 and 4). 

Relationship between FLP-CGM-derived metrics and carotid 
atherosclerosis among groups based on achievement of 
target CGM-derived metrics Finally, we performed a post 
hoc sensitivity analysis to investigate how atherosclerosis 
progression was affected by achieving target CGM-derived 
metrics. Participants were divided into two groups based on 
whether or not they achieved target CGM-derived metrics 

Table 3 Associations between 
CV or TIR and annual changes 
in GSM in the adjusted model 

at baseline. There was a significant difference in annual 
change in mean GSM between participants who achieved 
the target CGM-derived metrics and those who did not after 
adjustment for other conventional potential risk factors for 
atherosclerosis (Table 5). 

Discussion 

To our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal that TIR and 
CV are associated with changes in ultrasonic tissue characteristics 
of the carotid artery wall, even after adjusting for various 
risk factors, including HbA1c. In addition, participants who 
achieved the target CGM-derived metrics proposed by the international 
consensus demonstrated significant annual changes in 
mean GSM compared with those who did not. These results 
underscore the importance of including these CGM-derived 
metrics as a part of optimal diabetes management in conjunction 
with HbA1c, and indicate the need for further studies to 
clarify the threshold of change in GSM for predicting CVD 
and to assess whether targeting TIR and CV could prevent the 
progression of atherosclerosis and/or CVD onset.

The TIR target achievement group consisted of participants who fulfilled all of the following criteria at 
baseline: TIR >70%, TAR>10 mmol/l <25%, TAR>13.9 mmol/l <5%, TBR<3.9 mmol/l <4% and TBR<3.0 mmol/l 
<1%. Group comparisons were performed using a linear regression model adjusted for potential conventional 
risk factors for atherosclerosis. 

Asterisk indicates a statistically significantly difference between those who achieved the target and those 
who did not 

Notably, we found that there was a significant greater change 
in thickened-lesion GSM in participants with lower CV and 
higher TIR classified by tertiles, and thickened-lesion GSM 
change was numerically but non-significantly greater in participants 
who achieved the target CGM metrics than in those 
who did not. Theoretically, assessment of thickened lesions 
in the carotid arteries, including plaque, is more useful for 
predicting future CVD than the evaluation of mean GSM. 
However, it remains largely unknown whether longitudinal 
changes in thickened-lesion GSM are associated with the risk 
of CVD. This may be because the thickened carotid lesions 
evaluated at baseline were not necessarily always the same 
as those evaluated at other follow-up points, because of the 
inability to track changes in individual thickened lesions over 
time. At present, it is reasonable to state that changes in mean 
GSM constitute a more reproducible and reliable marker for 
predicting CVD. 

Previous cross-sectional studies demonstrated that glucose 
variability was associated with coronary or carotid 
plaque tissue characteristics [17, 39, 40]. In addition, to our 
knowledge, the current study is the first to provide evidence 
that CV was associated with changes in ultrasonic tissue 
characteristics of the carotid artery wall. Furthermore, the 
relationship between TIR, which may comprehensively 
reflect both glycaemic level and glycaemic variability [41], 
and mean GSM change or thickened-lesion GSM change, 
did not reach significance after adjusting for CV (data not 
shown), suggesting that glycaemic variability may be a 
major contributor. Although the exact mechanism of how 
glucose variability contributes to the tissue characteristics 
of the carotid vascular wall remains unclear, we propose the 
following possible scenario. Previous studies have shown 
that glucose variability induces inflammation and increases 
oxidative stress to a greater extent than chronic persistent 
hyperglycaemia [42], thus contributing to vascular damage. 
In agreement with these data, endothelial cell apoptosis 
caused by oxidative stress was more pronounced after 
intermittent hyperglycaemia than after persistent hyperglycaemia 
[43]. Accordingly, vascular walls may be damaged 
more by glucose variability than by chronic persistent 
hyperglycaemia. 

In cross-sectional studies, the relationship between glucose 
variability and IMT is inconsistent [16, 17, 19]. In 
addition, we found no significant association between FLPCGM-
derived metrics, including glucose variability metrics, 
and annual changes in mean IMT and CCA-max-IMT. Thus, 
it remains inconclusive whether glucose variability affects 
carotid IMT. Previous studies demonstrated that people with 
type 2 diabetes had a greater mean IMT than those without 
[44, 45], and their annual increase in IMT (0.034 mm/ 
year) was also greater (0.007–0.008 mm/year in a healthy 
population) [33]. Our study enrolled people with a stable 
glucose-lowering treatment regimen and no apparent history 

of symptomatic CVD who visited an outpatient clinic for 
routine medical care. Therefore, our participants had relatively 
low HbA1c levels as well as higher TIR and lower CV. 
Also, BP and lipid variables were relatively well controlled, 
and BMI was not very high. Not surprisingly, the mean IMT 
of 0.759 mm in our participants was relatively low, and the 
annual changes in mean IMT (0.008 mm/year) and CCAmax-
IMT (0.004 mm/year) were smaller than those in a 
previous prospective cohort study [46]. Under these conditions, 
glucose variability may not greatly contribute to the 
progression of carotid IMT. Further studies are needed to 
clarify these relationships. 

It remains unclear why FLP-CGM-derived metrics were 
associated with the annual changes in GSM but not the 
changes in IMT. This may be because IMT and GSM have 
different relationships with major atherosclerosis risk factors 
[32, 47]. Furthermore, carotid IMT and GSM reflect different 
pathogenic processes of atherosclerosis, even though the 
two variables are modestly correlated with each other [32]. A 
previous study examining the morphological features of early 
human atherosclerosis demonstrated that, in atherosclerosisprone 
arteries, including carotid arteries, extracellular lipid 
deposition begins to occur in the outer layer of pre-existing 
lesions with diffuse intimal thickening [48]. As the lesion 
progresses, lipids continue to accumulate in the outer layer 
of the thickened intima of the fatty streak, but do not cause 
a biologically important change in intimal thickness [49]. 
Then, stimulated macrophages accumulate in the fatty streak 
and infiltrate the accumulated lipid, leading to pathological 
intimal thickening with foam cells [49]. Accordingly, a 
change in tissue characteristics can precede IMT thickening 
in the early stage of atherosclerosis. Taken together, it is 
possible that persistent hyperglycaemia, glucose fluctuations 
and/or hypoglycaemia differentially affect IMT thickening 
and tissue characteristics of the vascular wall. 

The strengths of this study included its relatively large 
sample size and multicentre design. However, the study had 
several limitations. First, it was a short-term, observational 
study, and therefore had drawbacks similar to all analyses of 
this type. Second, FLP-CGM-derived metrics were evaluated 
based on FLP-CGM measurements obtained during limited 
periods of 8 consecutive days at baseline and at 104 weeks. 
Thus, these metrics may not represent the participants’ overall 
glycaemic control. To most accurately assess baseline glucose 
variability using FLP-CGM, we only recruited people 
who were on a stable glucose-lowering treatment regimen. In 
addition, we employed a blind CGM system that prevented 
participants from altering their lifestyle behaviours based on 
the results of glucose readings. However, FLP-CGM measurements 
at 104 weeks were not performed in all participants 
and were obtained in the absence of any treatment restrictions. 
Last-minute changes in medications may greatly affect 
FLP-CGM metrics. This limitation may have made it difficult 

to evaluate the relationships between changes in FLP-CGM 
metrics and changes in index values for carotid atherosclerosis. 
Similarly, post hoc analysis showed no significant 
associations between mean values in FLP-CGM-derived 
metrics at baseline and 104 weeks and the annual changes in 
these values (data not shown). Repeated FLP-CGM measurements 
during the study period would have been required 
to clarify this point. Third, potential confounders were not 
included in the multivariate regression analysis. In particular, 
changes in the frequency of medication use, including use of 
glucagon-like peptide-1 antagonists, may have affected the 
results. Fourth, we recruited Japanese people with type 2 
diabetes and without a history of symptomatic CVD. Given 
these inclusion criteria, a very limited number of people with 
carotid artery stenosis were included, although approximately 
80% of participants had one or more carotid plaques at baseline. 
In addition, our participants had a TIR of approximately 
80% and a CV of approximately 26% at baseline and 104 
weeks. Accordingly, in our participants, TIR was more than 
acceptable and CV was much lower than the target CGMderived 
metrics proposed by an international consensus [27], 
suggesting that blood glucose in our participants was relatively 
well controlled. These constraints may have limited 
the generalisability of our results. Finally, multiple testing in 
exploratory and sensitivity analyses increases the chance of 
false-positive findings, and thus our results should be interpreted 
with caution. 

In conclusion, TIR and CV were significantly associated 
with changes in the tissue characteristics of the carotid artery 
wall, independently of HbA1c, in people with type 2 diabetes 
and no apparent history of symptomatic CVD. Thus, in 
conjunction with HbA1c, these metrics may provide useful 
information for predicting atherosclerotic changes.
