Introduction 

The global prevalence of obesity, which is associated with 
an increased risk of CVD [1, 2], is increasing. Clinical 
guidelines from the American Heart Association and 
ADA recommend weight loss of 5–8% for overweight 
and obese individuals to prevent CVD [3–6]. As the 
first-line treatment option for obesity, lifestyle interventions 
have been shown to aid weight loss and improve 
cardiometabolic health markers in several large-scale 


studies [7–10]. However, it is unclear whether the clinical 
guidelines benefit specific populations or whether 
personalised lifestyle interventions are needed. 

Older adults (=65 years) have attracted much attention, as 
they are highly likely to suffer from muscle and bone loss, 
sarcopenia and frailty during weight loss interventions, 
despite improvements in cardiometabolic health [11]. A 
systematic review suggested that lifestyle interventions 
were similarly effective at promoting weight loss and 
cardiometabolic health in older (=60 years) and younger 
(<60 years) adults, but this conclusion was mainly based 
on short-or medium-term (=2 years) studies and/or studies 
with a focus on older adults only [12]. A secondary 
analysis of the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look 
AHEAD) trial showed that, compared with middle-aged 
adults (45–64 years), older adults (65–76 years) lost more 
body weight and had comparable improvements in cardiometabolic 
health markers during a 4 year lifestyle intervention 
[13]. Few studies have compared changes in body 
composition and cardiometabolic health markers during a 
long-term (>2 years) lifestyle intervention in younger 
(25–45 years), middle-aged (46–54 years) and older 
(55–70 years) adults. 

With regard to sex differences, a systematic review of 
RCTs of weight loss interventions reported that men 
demonstrated greater weight loss than women [14], 
whereas the concurrent change in cardiometabolic health 
markers is unknown. We have previously reported that 
women and men responded differently to an 8 week 
low-energy diet (LED) to induce rapid weight loss with 
regard to body weight and cardiometabolic health markers 
[15], but whether these effects will be long-lasting is 
unclear. A recent 2 year study found that there were no 
sex differences in intraorgan fat change and CVD risk 
after diet-induced weight loss [16], but the findings were 
limited by the small sample size. 

The PREVention of diabetes through lifestyle interventions 
and population studies In Europe and around 
the World (PREVIEW) study was a 3 year, large-scale 
RCT of a lifestyle intervention for the prevention of 
diabetes in a large overweight population with prediabetes 
[17]. Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes have been 
demonstrated to be associated with an increased risk of 
CVD [18, 19] and the increased risk has been found to 
be mainly driven by abnormal levels of cardiometabolic 
health markers (e.g. blood pressure) [20]. Therefore, in 
the present observational study, we aimed to examine 
age-and sex-specific effects of a LED followed by a 
lifestyle-based weight maintenance (WM) intervention 
on body weight and cardiometabolic health markers in 
the PREVIEW participants. In addition, we compared 
the cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes among age 
and sex groups. 

Methods 

Study design and participants The PREVIEW study 
(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01777893) was a long-term, largescale 
RCT conducted at eight intervention centres in 
Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, the UK, Spain, 
Bulgaria, Australia and New Zealand. The detailed study 
design and main findings have been published [15, 17, 21]. 
Briefly, the primary outcome of the study was the impact of a 
high-protein/low-glycaemic index (HP/LGI) diet and a 
moderate-protein/moderate-glycaemic index (MP/MGI) diet 
on the risk of type 2 diabetes. The PREVIEW protocol was 
approved by the human ethics committee at each intervention 
centre (see electronic supplementary material [ESM] Table 1). 
The PREVIEW study was conducted in accordance with the 
Declaration of Helsinki. 

Overweight or obese (BMI =25 kg/m2) adult participants 
aged 25–70 years with prediabetes were enrolled from 
June 2013 to April 2015. At the screening visit, an OGTT 
with 75 g glucose was conducted and those with impaired 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance 
were considered to have prediabetes, according to ADA 
criteria [22]. FPG and 2 h plasma glucose were measured 
using a glucose analyser. All eligible participants provided 
written informed consent. 

Interventions The PREVIEW study consisted of two 
phases.Phase 1was an8weekrapidweight loss 
(WL) phase with a LED (3400 kJ/day) [15]and phase 
2 was a 148 week WM phase. Those who failed to 
achieve the target weight reduction (>8% of initial body 
weight) were excluded. During the WM phase, participants 
were randomised into one of the four diet and 
physical activity (PA) combined intervention groups. 
Randomisation was stratified by age group (younger: 
25–45 years; middle-aged: 46–54 years; older: 55– 
70 years) and sex (women and men). In defining the 
age range of each age group both the age classification 
from the World Health Organization [23] and the age 
range of menopause in women (44–54 years; menopause 
is associated with an increased risk of CVD [24]) were 
taken into consideration. 

During the WM phase, participants were advised to 
consume an HP/LGI diet (25 E% [% energy] protein, 45 
E% carbohydrates, GI <50) or an MP/MGI diet (15 E% 
protein, 55 E% carbohydrates, GI 56–70) combined with 
either high-or moderate-intensity PA. The high-intensity 
PA programme consisted of high-intensity PA (e.g. aerobics 
with very vigorous effort) for 75 min/week and the 
moderate-intensity PA programme consisted of moderateintensity 
PA (e.g. conditioning exercises) for 150 min/ 
week. Diets were consumed ad libitum without energy 
restriction. Counselling visits were conducted to improve 

diet and PA compliance, with decreasing frequency as the 
trial progressed [25]. Outcomes were collected at seven 
clinical investigation days (CIDs 1–7 at 0, 8, 26, 52, 78, 
104 and 156 weeks, respectively); a detailed overview of 
the data collected at the different time points is provided 
in ESM Table 2. We allowed the following visit windows 
for data collection: at 8 weeks: -3 to +5 days; at 26 weeks: 
±1 week; at 52 weeks: ±2 weeks; remaining time points: 
±4 weeks. Adherence to the diets was evaluated using 
4 day food records and adherence to the PA programmes 
was evaluated using 7 day accelerometry data. 

This observational study is a post hoc, secondary analysis 
focusing on the secondary outcomes, including body weight 
and composition and cardiometabolic health markers. We 
merged all participants into one intervention group and 
reclassified them by sex and age range used in the original 
randomisation, because (1) there was no significant interaction 
of intervention arm and age or sex and (2) diet and PA 
compliance were lower than expected [17]. 

Outcome measures The measurements of body weight, waist 
circumference, fat mass, fat-free mass (FFM), bone mineral 
content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), FPG, 2 h plasma 
glucose, HbA1c, fasting triacylglycerol, HDL-cholesterol, 
LDL-cholesterol, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic 
blood pressure (DBP) were carried out as described previously 
[15, 17]. Briefly, all blood samples were drawn from the 
antecubital vein of participants in a fasting state (except for 
2 h plasma glucose), stored at -80°C and transported to the 
Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare for analysis. 

Type 2 diabetes ascertainment Type 2 diabetes was defined 
according to World Health Organization and ADA criteria 
[22, 26] and was diagnosed either (1) by an OGTT (FPG 
=7.0 mmol/l and/or 2 h plasma glucose =11.1 mmol/l) 
conducted at the intervention centres or (2) by a medical 
doctor. Most participants dropped out or completed the study 
by week 156, but some had a longer (>156 weeks) survival 
time because of the visit windows. We assumed that 
their last status was observed at 156 weeks. 

Statistical analysis Linear mixed models were used to examine 
the associations of age and sex with changes in outcomes of 
interest during the 3 year lifestyle intervention from baseline 
to 156 weeks in all participants (available case analysis). 
Covariates that might influence the outcomes of interest 
[27–30] were added into the models (ESM Methods). Model 
1 included age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, baseline smoking 
status, baseline alcohol consumption, baseline energy intake 
and baseline PA, changes in energy intake and PA from baseline, 
baseline values of outcomes, intervention arm, time 
(categorical) and a two-way interaction of time and age group 
or sex as fixed covariates and participant identifier and 

intervention centre as random effects. Model 2 additionally 
included percentage weight loss from baseline as a fixed 
covariate when cardiometabolic health markers were added 
as a dependent variable. If the interaction term was significant, 
post hoc multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction or 
pairwise comparisons (independent samples t tests) were 
conducted at each time point. Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted in those who completed the study or by additionally 
adjusting for carbohydrate, protein, fat and fibre intakes. 
For body composition outcomes, the models were additionally 
adjusted for light PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, sedentary 
time and wear time. 

The associations of percentage weight loss or weight regain 
with changes in cardiometabolic health markers during the 
rapid WL phase or the WM phase by age and sex were examined 
using linear mixed models including age, sex, ethnicity, 
baseline BMI, baseline smoking status, baseline alcohol 
consumption, baseline energy intake and PA, baseline values 
of outcomes, percentage weight loss from baseline and a twoway 
interaction of percentage weight loss and age group or 
sex as fixed covariates and intervention centre as a random 
effect. For weight regain, the models additionally included 
percentage regain weight and intervention arm as fixed 
covariates. 

Cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes by age and sex 
was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method, without 
adjustment. Diabetes incidence was compared among age 
and sex groups using a time-dependent Cox hazards regression 
model adjusted for loge(time) × sex or age, ethnicity, 
baseline smoking status, baseline alcohol consumption, baseline 
BMI, baseline FPG, baseline 2 h plasma glucose, baseline 
PA and baseline energy intake, changes in PA and energy 
intake from baseline, intervention arm and intervention site 
as covariates. The proportional hazards assumption was evaluated 
using a Wald test of the interaction of time and age or 
sex. 

Missing data, including dietary intake, PA and changes in 
outcomes of interest, were imputed using the expectation 
maximisation algorithm. The normality of residuals was determined 
using histograms and P–P plots. Data were analysed 
using IBM SPSS v28.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA) and 
OriginPro 2020 software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, 
USA). The statistical test was two-sided and p<0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.

baseline values of the outcome being considered, time-varying 
percentage weight loss from baseline, baseline energy intake and PA, 
time-varying changes in energy intake and PA from baseline,

after adjusting for dietary intake. In the complete case analysis, 
there were no significant differences in the abovementioned 
outcomes between middle-aged and older adults 
at 156 weeks, but the direction of effect was the same (ESM 
Fig. 4). 

Changes in body weight and cardiometabolic health markers 
by sex In the available case analysis, compared with men, 
women lost less body weight (adjusted mean difference at 
8 weeks 1.74 kg [95% CI 1.07, 2.41], p<0.001; 1.12% [95% 
CI 0.47, 1.78], p<0.001; Fig. 4 and ESM Fig. 5, respectively) 
but more FFM (kg and %) at 8 weeks and had less sustained 
weight loss (adjusted mean difference at 156 weeks 1.39 kg 
[95% CI 0.71, 2.06], p<0.001; 1.78% [95% CI 1.12, 2.43], 
p<0.001) and less change in FFM during the WM phase. In 
addition, women lost more BMC and BMD than men over 
3 years. The above-mentioned results remained robust in the 
complete case analysis. The significant differences in FFM 
and BMC remained after additionally adjusting for PA type. 

In the available case analysis, compared with men, women 
had smaller decreases in FPG, HbA1c, triacylglycerol, LDLcholesterol 
and DBP and greater decreases in HDLcholesterol 
at 8 weeks (ESM Fig. 6). After the WM phase, 
women had greater improvements in FPG and HDLcholesterol 
than men, while they had smaller improvements 
in HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol. After adjustment for percent-
age weight loss, the significant differences in HbA1c,LDLcholesterol, 
HDL-cholesterol and DBP between women and 
men remained at 8 weeks (Fig. 5). In this analysis, after the 
WM phase, women had greater improvements in FPG, triacylglycerol, 
HDL-cholesterol, SBP and DBP than men (adjusted 
mean difference at 156 weeks in FPG -0.15 mmol/l [95% 
CI -0.18, -0.11], p<0.001; SBP -1.41 mmHg [95% CI -2.34, 
-0.48], p=0.003; triacylglycerol -0.08 mmol/l [95% CI 
-0.11, -0.04], p<0.001; Fig. 5), while they had smaller 
improvements in HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol. The above


mentioned results remained robust after adjusting for dietary 
intake. In the complete case analysis, there were no significant 
differences in SBP and DBP between women and men at 
156 weeks, but the direction of effect was the same (ESM 
Fig. 7). 

Associations of weight change with cardiometabolic health 
markers Rapid weight loss was associated with greater 
improvements in SBP in older adults than younger adults 
(ESM Table 5). Weight loss was associated with smaller 
improvements in FPG, triacylglycerol, HDL-cholesterol, 
LDL-cholesterol, SBP and DBP in women than men. 
During the WM phase, weight regain was associated with 
more adverse FPG, HbA1c and SBP in older vs younger 
adults. 

Type 2 diabetes incidence The total number of cases of type 2 
diabetes was 69 (seven during the rapid WL phase and 62 
during the WM phase; 13 younger, 14 middle-aged and 42 
older adults; 48 women and 21 men). The 3 year cumulative 
incidence was 4.6% in younger, 8.8% in middle-aged and 
6.6% in older adults; and 6.8% in women and 5.6% in men 
(Fig. 6). The adjusted hazard ratio was 0.43 (95% CI 0.20, 

0.89) for older vs middle-aged adults (p=0.02). 
Discussion 

We found that the cardiometabolic benefits of a LED followed 
by a lifestyle intervention differed by age and sex in overweight 
adults with prediabetes. Older adults benefited less 
from a lifestyle-based WM intervention in relation to body 
composition and cardiometabolic health markers than younger 
adults, despite greater sustained weight loss. Women 
benefited less from the lifestyle intervention in relation to 
body weight and composition and cardiometabolic health 
markers than men. After the lifestyle-based WM phase, 
women showed greater improvements in fasting glucose, 
triacylglycerol and HDL-cholesterol, and smaller improvements 
in HbA1c and LDL-cholesterol. Older adults had a 
lower incidence of type 2 diabetes at the end of the study than 
middle-aged adults. 

Several potential mechanisms may explain the observed 
age and sex differences in the present study. Ageing may lead 
to the redistribution of adipose tissue, from subcutaneous to 
visceral depots [31]. Distribution of adipose tissue is also 
affected by sex [32]. Epidemiological studies have confirmed 
the association of visceral adiposity with deteriorating metabolic 
outcomes, whereas subcutaneous adipose tissue has 
been found to be associated with protective properties [33]. 
In addition, epigenetic age acceleration was found to be positively 
correlated with glucose and the triacylglycerol–glucose 
index [34].

In the adapted DPP, the intervention lasted only 10 months, 
whereas in our study we did not find significant differences in 
weight loss between younger and older adults until 52 weeks.

Regarding prevention of FFM and BMC loss, an RCT demonstrated 
that resistance exercise was associated with a lower

Fig. 6 Cumulative incidence of type 2 diabetes by age and sex (n=2223). 
Values are cumulative incidence of diabetes by age (a)and sex(b) at each 
time point. Diabetes was diagnosed by an OGTT with 75 g glucose or by 
a medical doctor. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan– 
Meier method, without adjustment. The incidence of diabetes was 
compared among age groups or between women and men using a timedependent 
Cox hazards regression model adjusted for loge(time) × age or 
sex, ethnicity, baseline smoking status, baseline alcohol consumption, 
baseline BMI, baseline FPG, baseline 2 h plasma glucose, baseline PA 
and baseline energy intake, changes in PA and energy intake from baseline, 
intervention arm and intervention site as covariates 

In addition, in the adapted DPP, participants were divided into 
only two age groups (<65 vs =65 years), whereas in our study 
we compared three age groups. 

Notably, the above-mentioned studies did not report body 
composition data and the present study therefore adds to the 
evidence base by exploring long-term changes in body 
composition among age groups. Less weight regain but also 

older adults, who had more adverse metabolic profiles at baseline, 
had a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes at the end of the 
study than middle-aged adults. This might be partly explained 
by the effect of menopause on the risk of type 2 diabetes in 
middle-aged women [43]. Selection bias caused by a high 
attrition rate may be another explanation. 

In terms of sex differences in changes in body weight and 
body composition, in a previous PREVIEW publication we 
reported that women lost less body weight but more FFM and 
BMC than men during the rapid weight loss phase [15]; in the 
present study these patterns were the same during the WM 
phase. Our findings on sex differences in weight loss are in 
line with a meta-analysis of six lifestyle-based weight loss 
RCTs [14] and a recent study on sex differences in intraorgan 
fat levels and hepatic lipid metabolism [16]. In addition, a 
systematic review suggested that men tend to lose more 
weight with intensive low-fat reducing diets and PA 
programmes than women [44]. However, a review argued that 
the observed sex differences in weight loss are attributable to 
greater initial body weight or a greater degree of energy 

restriction in men, instead of inherent sex differences [32]. In 
the present study, the difference in weight loss still remained 
after adjustment for baseline body weight and change in energy 
intake from baseline. Considering body composition, in 
agreement with our findings, Evans et al [45] also found that 
men lost body fat (%) more effectively than women in a 1 year 
weight loss trial including dietary interventions and exercise 
guidance. In addition, Tirosh et al [46] found that women had 
a greater increase in the fat mass/FFM ratio and a greater 
reduction in BMD than men during a lifestyle-based weight 
loss intervention. Accordingly, it may be important for 
women to prevent FFM and BMC loss when participating in 
weight management programmes. Current data show that 
dietary protein may affect body composition [47], but in the 
present study the sex-specific differences in fat mass and 
BMC remained significant even after adjusting for protein 
intake. Moreover, our findings were also independent of PA 
type (i.e. light PA and moderate-to-vigorous PA). Previous 
studies have found that other types of PA (e.g. resistance exercise 
and aerobic exercise) may have different effects on body 
composition [47] and future studies should therefore investi-
gate whether sex influences these effects. 

A recent review suggested that sex may be an important 
factor in determining the effect of dietary or lifestyle interventions 
on cardiometabolic health [48]. In particular, Perreault 
et al [49] found that in the DPP lifestyle cohort, among those 
who lost >3% of their body weight, men appeared to have 
greater decreases in cardiometabolic health markers than 
women. However, this study did not include a diet-induced 
rapid WL phase and DPP investigators were therefore not able 
to observe sex differences in changes in cardiometabolic 
health markers during a rapid WL phase and a WM phase. 
In the present study, we showed that men benefited more in 
terms of body weight and composition and cardiometabolic 
health markers from the diet-induced WL phase. In addition, 
weight loss was associated with greater improvements in 
cardiometabolic health markers in men than women during 
the rapid WL phase. These findings suggest that the LED 
and rapid weight loss may be more effective in CVD prevention 
in men than in women. 

The present study has some strengths. The large sample 
size and representative populations from eight countries could 
be considered a strength. Because of the wide age range 
included, we were able to compare differences in outcomes 
among younger, middle-aged and older adults. In addition, 
unlike short-term studies, our study was able to address longer 
term comorbidities associated with obesity and related 
diseases such as CVD. The present study also has limitations. 
First, the attrition rate was higher than expected, which resulted 
in a high percentage of missing data. To reduce the bias, we 
imputed the missing data and carried out a complete case 
analysis. Most of our findings in younger vs older adults and 
women vs men remained robust in the complete case analysis. 

Moreover, the significant differences in younger vs older 
adults also remained in weight-adjusted models. Significant 
differences between middle-aged adults and other age groups, 
however, disappeared in the complete case analysis, but the 
direction of effect was the same. This may be because the 
differences were small and were not detectable in the small 
sample size (completers). Finally, the design and statistical 
analysis of the present secondary analysis were not 
prespecified and the baseline characteristics of subgroups 
were not precisely balanced. We adjusted for baseline BMI 
and outcomes, but it was not possible to completely remove 
some other participant-specific baseline characteristics, especially 
CVD and type 2 diabetes risk. These unmeasured and 
unadjusted confounders may have influenced the results. 
Taken together, given the existence of bias, our findings 
should be interpreted with caution and warrant further repli-
cation in an independent study. 

In conclusion, this observational study found that, in a large 
population of overweight adults with prediabetes, the 
cardiometabolic benefits of a LED followed by a lifestyle 
intervention differed by age and sex. Older adults benefited 
less from the lifestyle intervention in relation to body 
composition and cardiometabolic health markers than 
younger adults. Women benefited less from the LED 
followed by the lifestyle intervention in relation to body 
weight and body composition than men. Our findings 
suggest that future weight management programmes 
designed for older adults or women may want to consider 
the prevention of FFM and bone mass loss. However, 
given that this is a hypothesis-generating study, independent 
replication is needed before the implementation of 
age-and sex-specific interventions.
