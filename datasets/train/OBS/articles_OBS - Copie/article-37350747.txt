Introduction

Cardiogenic shock (CS) in the setting of severe aortic stenosis (AS) carries a 
poor prognosis. It leads to a vicious cycle of subendocardial ischaemia, reduced 
preload and increased afterload, ultimately resulting in acute decompensation 
and death.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Previous studies in AS patients with CS who 
underwent successful balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) reported a 
30-day mortality of 33%–47%,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
1-year mortality of 70%,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
and 2-year mortality 
of 90%.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Therefore, conservative therapy leads to poor outcomes in 
these patients. Most patients in CS are denied surgical aortic valve replacement 
because of increased peri-operative risk of morbidity and mortality. 
Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become an attractive 
alternative because of the less invasive nature of this procedure.

It is estimated that 1%–4% of the patients undergoing TAVR may 
present with CS.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Because of the low prevalence, prior single and multi- 
centre studies have been limited by a small sample size. An earlier study 
from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)/American College of 
Cardiology (ACC) Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry (TVT-R-R) 
reported the outcomes of TAVR in 2220 patients in CS from 2014 
to 2017.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
However, many of these patients underwent TAVR with older 
generation valves, the primary endpoint was limited to 30-day outcomes, 
and only patients >65 years were included. Meanwhile, TAVR 
volumes continue to increase, operator volume and experience continue 
to grow, and newer device platforms have been introduced.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
The safety and efficacy of TAVR with new generation transcatheter heart 
valves in patients with CS remains largely unknown. Accordingly, we 


analysed the TVT-R-R data to report in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year outcomes 
of TAVR with balloon-expandable bioprosthesis in patients with 
AS and CS in a contemporary real-world setting. We also report the predictors 
of 1-year mortality in this population.

Methods

Study population

Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR with contemporary 
balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valves [SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 
3 Ultra (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA)] in the USA, between 
17 June 2015 and 30 September 2022, were evaluated in the current 
study. Patient eligibility for treatment with TAVR was determined by 
each site using their local heart team and standard of care procedures. 
All data were site-reported as per standards set by the STS/ACC TVT- 
R-R. As a requirement by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services, the TVT-R-R includes all patients who undergo TAVR in the 
USA. The data are frequently audited for accuracy and represent a real- 
world population. Details of the TVT-R-R have been reported previously.

The study has been approved by a central institutional review board 
(Advarra) and granted a waiver of informed consent by the Duke 
University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board under the 
Common Rule 45 CFR 46.3. The analyses were performed on data downloaded 
by Edwards Lifesciences from the STS/ACC TVT-R-R. Since the 
data sharing agreement between Edwards Lifesciences and the STS/ 
ACC is restricted to valve manufactured by Edwards Lifesciences only, 
this analysis was based only on the Edwards SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 
Ultra valves as previously.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/


The primary group of interest included patients with CS who underwent 
TAVR. CS was defined as the (i) coding of CS within 24 h of procedure 
on the TVT-R form (n = 1922); and/or (ii) pre-procedural use of 
inotropes (n = 3678) or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices 
(intra-aortic balloon pump, n = 411; catheter-based assist device, 
n = 364); and/or (iii) cardiac arrest within 24 h prior to TAVR (n = 371). 
Detailed definitions of these categories are provided in the supplementary 
data. There was overlap in these groups as the same patient could be included 
in multiple categories, giving us a final study population of 5006 CS 
patients. The control group comprised patients undergoing TAVR without 
underlying CS. There were many patients who were labelled as ‘elective’ 
and ‘CS’ on the TVT-R forms but had TAVR on the same day of 
admission. These were assumed to be most likely mislabelled based on 
intra-procedural inotropes or coding errors. Therefore, we performed 
a sensitivity analysis after excluding the same day TAVR and ‘elective status’ 
patients. This confirmed that this specific group was not as sick and 
was probably mislabelled, as the mean STS score was in the intermediate 
category at 4.9, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was in the 
normal range (55%), and only 0.5% had moderate-severe mitral regurgitation 
(MR) (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
). Some patients may 
have been same day transfers from outside hospitals; however, those 
numbers should be low and may not affect the overall results. Based on 
this analysis, we excluded these patients from the CS group and included 
them in the non-CS group. http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
present the results of the whole cohort of 9499 patients prior to exclusion. 
The results are similar to the selected cohort but suggest a lower 
risk CS population because of possible mislabelling of same day elective 
TAVRs as CS.

Procedural and clinical outcomes

The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality at 1 year. 
Procedural characteristics, major complications, and in-hospital outcomes 
were reported. Implant success was defined as successful deployment of 
a single TAVR device in the proper anatomical location. Technical success 
(at exit from procedure room) was defined using the Valve Academic 
Research Consortium (VARC)-3 criteria as freedom from mortality, 
successful deployment of the device, and freedom from surgery or intervention 
related to the device or to a major vascular or access-related or cardiac 
structural complication.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular 
events including all-cause mortality, cardiac death, stroke, aortic valve reintervention, 
life-threatening bleeding, major vascular complication, new dialysis, 
new onset atrial fibrillation, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), 
permanent pacemaker (PPM), valve-related readmission, and any readmission 
were assessed at 30 days and 1 year post-TAVR. New York Heart 
Association (NYHA) functional class and quality of life (QoL) determined 
by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire overall summary score 
(KCCQ OS) were also reported at 30 days and 1 year after TAVR. 
Landmark analysis was performed using 30 days post-TAVR as a landmark 
point.

Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were presented as mean (SD) or median [interquartile 
range (IQR)] and were compared between groups using the two-sample 
t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. Categorical variables were presented as 
frequencies and percentages and were compared using the .2 or Fisher’s 
exact test. The 30-day and 1-year adverse event rates were based on 
Kaplan–Meier estimates, and all comparisons were made using the log-rank 
test. Patients who were lost to follow-up or withdrew were censored at the 
time of their last known alive status. A propensity score matching analysis 
was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics and potential 
confounders that may lead to biased estimates of the CS vs. non-CS 
group comparison. The propensity score was calculated by logistic regression 
including the following baseline covariates: age, sex, body mass index, 
access site, prior PCI, prior coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, 
prior stroke, carotid stenosis, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), hypertension, 
diabetes, chronic lung disease (CLD), immunocompromise status, porcelain 
aorta, atrial fibrillation, creatinine level, haemoglobin level, estimated 
glomerular filtration rate, aortic valve mean gradient, LVEF, MR, tricuspid 
regurgitation (TR), NYHA functional class III/IV, 5-meter walk test, 
KCCQ OS score, currently on dialysis, prior PPM placement, previous implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement, aortic regurgitation 
(AR), prior transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or stroke, endocarditis, use 
of home oxygen, and STS score. Missing baseline data were imputed using 
the Markov–Chain Monte Carlo method prior to modelling. Missing values 
were imputed five times, and the mean propensity score within an individual 
was used for final matching. http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
presents 
the percentage of patients with missing baseline characteristics values. 
Based on their propensity scores, each CS patient was matched to a 
non-CS patient 1:1 to create two balanced cohorts, using a greedy matching 
strategy with a calliper of width equal to 0.02 of the SD of the logit of the 
propensity score. Residual differences after propensity matching were assessed 
using absolute standardized differences of each covariate and displayed 
using a Love plot. Sensitivity analyses were performed to 
investigate the robustness of the results. The outcomes were assessed in 
an additional propensity score-matched cohort of patients labelled CS 
but were admitted on the same day as TAVR. This sensitivity analysis was 
performed without imputation. These patients were subsequently excluded 
from the ‘CS’ group and were incorporated into the ‘non-CS’ group 
as explained above. Univariate analysis was performed to determine the 
baseline characteristics that were predictive of 30-day and 1-year all-cause 
mortality. A multivariable Cox proportional hazard model with a stepwise 
selection method of significant predictors using entry and exit criterion of 
P = 0.1 was used to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality 
at 30 days and 1 year in CS patients. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated 
for four pre-specified sub-groups using a multivariable Cox proportional 
hazard analysis adjusting for all the covariates used in the propensity 
score. Paired t-test was performed to analyse the change in KCCQ score 
and LVEF from baseline to 1 year in patients who had complete data at 
all the time points. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 
9.4 (SAS Institute), and statistical significance was set at a two-sided P < 0.05 
without multiplicity adjustment.

Results

Baseline characteristics

Of the 309 505 patients who underwent TAVR with balloon-expandable 
SAPIEN 3 (S3) and SAPIEN 3 Ultra (S3U) valves during the study period, 
1.6% (n = 5006) presented with CS prior to the TAVR. Of the 5006 patients 
with CS, 12% (n = 601) underwent valve in valve (ViV), and 4405 
patients underwent TAVR in native aortic valve. Two-thirds of the patients 
received S3 valve (n = 3343), and one-third had S3U (n = 1663) 
valves. The median (IQR) number of days from date of admission to 
the TAVR procedure was 5 (2–9) days. Complete follow-up for outcomes 
was available in 92.37% patients at 30 days and 76.35% patients 
at 1 year in the CS group. In the non-CS group, complete follow-up 
was available in 93.03% patients at 30 days and 76.86% patients at 1 
year. Patients in CS group were younger, less likely females, and had a significantly 
higher mean STS score compared to those not in CS. http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
shows the differences in baseline demographics, co-morbidities, and 
echocardiographic characteristics between the two groups. Overall, 
the CS group was much sicker with a higher prevalence of diabetes, atrial 
fibrillation, prior stroke, prior CABG, PAD, acute coronary syndrome 
(ACS), end-stage renal disease (ESRD), CLD, prior BAV, left main stenosis 
> 50%, or obstructive coronaryartery disease.

CS patients had a lower LVEF (39% vs. 56%), lower mean aortic gradient 
(40 mmHg vs. 42 mmHg), smaller effective aortic valve area (0.65 
vs. 0.71 cm2), higher frequency of bicuspid aortic valve (9% vs. 5%), 
=moderate AR (28% vs. 16%), and = moderate MR (45% vs. 25%). 
Transfemoral access (93% vs. 95%) was less common with higher use 
of transapical and axillary access in CS patients. Following propensity 
matching using the variables listed in the methods section, the sample 
size was reduced to 4952 patients in both groups. After propensity 
matching, there were no or minimal differences between the baseline 
characteristics as shown in http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
and http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data

In-hospital and 30-day outcomes

http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
presents the procedural and in-hospital differences between the 
matched CS and non-CS groups. In-hospital mortality was significantly 
higher in patients with CS compared with no CS [9.9% vs. 2.7%; odds 
ratio (OR), 3.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.02–4.39; P < 0.0001]. 
Cardiac death (5.9% vs. 1.5%), stroke (2.9% vs. 1.5%), new dialysis 
(3.5% vs. 1.1%), TIA, major vascular complication, life-threatening 
bleeding, new onset atrial fibrillation, and PCI were also significantly 
higher in the CS group compared to the non-CS group. There was 
no difference in aortic valve re-intervention, PPM rate, or peri- 
procedural myocardial infarction (MI). Conversion to open cardiac surgery 
(0.73% vs. 0.38%) and coronary compression or obstruction rate 
(0.40% vs. 0.18%) were higher in CS patients compared with non-CS, 
whereas annular dissection, aortic dissection, device embolization, 
and perforation rates were similar. Patients in the CS group had a higher 
frequency of general anaesthesia use and longer procedure times. 
Implant success was high and numerically similar (97.9% vs. 98.9%) in 
both groups. Technical success as defined by VARC-3 criteria was 
achieved in 94.5% of the patients presenting with CS compared to 
96.7% in the non-CS group (P < 0.0001). Median length of stay 
post-TAVR was more than double (5 vs. 2 days), and discharge to 
home was significantly lower (59% vs. 79%) in the CS group compared 
to the non-CS group. The rate of 30-day mortality (12.9% vs. 4.9%) and 
stroke (3.2% vs. 1.9%) was significantly higher in the CS group compared 
to the non-CS group (P < 0.0001). http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
shows the differences 
between other outcomes. Overall, the trends were similar to the in- 
hospital outcomes.

One-year outcomes of transcatheter 
aortic valve replacement in cardiogenic 
shock

http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
shows the 1-year outcomes in the matched group. Adjusted 
1-year mortality was significantly higher at 29.7% in the CS group compared 
to 22.6% in the non-CS group (HR, 1.57; 95% CI 1.43–1.72; P < 
0.001) (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
). The rates of stroke, life-threatening bleeding, major 
vascular complications, new dialysis, atrial fibrillation, and PCI were 
higher in the CS patients. The rates of PPM (9.3% vs. 9.1%), aortic valve 
re-intervention (0.83% vs. 0.54%), valve-related readmissions, and overall 
readmissions (39% vs. 38%) were similar in the CS and non-CS 
groups. In a landmark analysis after 30 days (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
), all-cause mortality 
was similar between the CS and non-CS groups (19.3% vs. 18.5%, HR, 
1.07; 95% CI 0.95–1.21; P = 0.26). http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data

specified subgroups within the CS patients. Patients with = moderate 
MR prior to TAVR had a significantly increased risk of 1-year mortality 
compared to those with = moderate MR (34.0% vs. 27.6%; P < 0.001) 
(http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
). After adjustment, =moderate MR was not a significant predictor 
of 1-year mortality (adjusted HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.93–1.22; P = 
0.34). When the CS population was stratified by LVEF, we noted the 
lowest all-cause mortality in patients with LVEF >40%. There was no 
difference in all-cause mortality between patients with LVEF <20% 
and 20%–40% (P = 0.96) (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
). After multivariate adjustment, 
LVEF prior to TAVR was not associated with 1-year mortality. 
Patients who underwent TAVR for native vs. ViV showed a trend towards 
higher 1-year mortality (HR 1.2; 95% CI, 0.98–1.44; P = 0.072), 
which became significant after multivariate adjustment (adjusted HR 
1.26; 95% CI 1.03–1.56; P = 0.028) (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data

shows the 
1-year outcomes of the CS subgroups. Combined use of MCS and inotropes 
was associated with the highest mortality followed by MCS only 
group. Those on inotropes alone, had cardiac arrest within 24 h or 
were entered as CS on the TVT-R form had similar 1-year mortality. 
On stratifying the CS patients by median number of days from admission 
to TAVR, we found that early TAVR (= 5 days) was associated with 
lower 30-day (11.6% vs. 14.3%, P = 0.02) and 1-year mortality (26.5% 
vs. 33.3%, P < 0.0001) compared to those who had TAVR after 5 
days from admission. After adjusting for covariates, early TAVR showed 
a trend towards lower 1-year mortality but was not significant (HR, 
0.91; 95% CI 0.81–1.03; P = 0.149).

shows the multivariate predictors of 30-day mortality after 
TAVR in CS. Age, lower mean gradient, lower albumin levels, lower 
KCCQ scores, ESRD, PPM rate, PAD, and use of MCS prior to 
TAVR were independently associated with increased 30-day mortality. http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
shows the multivariable predictors of all-cause mortality at 1 
year in patients with CS undergoing TAVR. Age (adjusted HR, 1.02; 95% 
CI 1.02–1.03), ESRD (adjusted HR, 2.07; 95% CI 1.69–2.53), immunocompromised 
status (adjusted HR, 1.33; 95% CI 1.05–1.69), previous 
ICD (adjusted HR, 1.37; 95% CI 1.07–1.77), and PAD (adjusted HR, 
1.25; 95% CI 1.06–1.47) were independently associated with increased 
mortality at 1-year in CS patients, whereas higher aortic mean gradient 
(adjusted HR, 0.98; 95% CI 0.98–0.99), higher albumin (adjusted HR, 
0.66; 95% CI 0.57–0.75), and higher haemoglobin (adjusted HR, 0.91; 
95% CI 0.87–0.95) were associated with lower 1-year mortality.

Echocardiographic and functional 
outcomes

At discharge, mean gradient (10 mmHg) and rate of moderate or severe 
paravalvular leak (PVL) (0.9%) were similar in CS and non-CS 
groups (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
). At 30-day follow-up, 
mean LVEF improved from baseline in CS patients (39% to 46%), and 
mean gradients and rate of moderate/severe PVL (1.4%) stayed stable. 
Patients who survived to 1 year noted further improvement in LVEF to 
52% with similar mean gradients and PVL rates (0.93%). In a paired analysis 
of patients who had echocardiographic data at baseline, 30 days, 
and 1 year, change in LVEF was similar amongst CS (. mean LVEF 
6.5%) and non-CS groups (. mean LVEF 6.7%, P = 0.54) at 30 days. 
At 1 year, CS patients (. mean LVEF 11.9%) were noted to have a higher 
improved EF compared to non-CS patients (. mean LVEF 10.0%, 
P = 0.002). There was a significant improvement in NYHA class from 
baseline to 30 days and 1 year (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
) with 88% of patients in NYHA class I/II at 1 year. Similarly, 
KCCQ OS scores improved significantly from 28 at baseline to 80 at 
1 year (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
).

Discussion

This large real-world observational study demonstrates that TAVR with 
contemporary balloon expandable S3 and S3U valves is a safe and effective 
treatment option for patients presenting with CS. The rate of 
in-hospital and 30-day mortality after TAVR in patients with CS was 
9.9% and 12.9%, which is considerably lower than the reported mortality 
of 35%–70% in conservatively managed patients.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
The 30-day 
landmark analysis showed no difference in mortality between the 
propensity-matched CS and non-CS groups suggesting a good long- 
term prognosis if patients survive the initial post-procedural stay. 
Additionally, the majority of survivors were doing well at 1 year with 
significant improvements in NYHA functional class and QoL assessed 
by KCCQ OS scores. The rate of major and minor complications 
post-TAVR was low, and procedural success was high despite the presence 
of CS. Lastly, we found that older age, lower mean gradient, lower 
albumin, ESRD, immunocompromised state, prior ICD, and PAD were

This is the largest study to date exploring the outcomes of TAVR in 
patients presenting with CS in the contemporary era of third- and 
fourth-generation transcatheter heart valves. A previous analysis 
from TVT-R-Rhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
reported the outcomes of TAVR in CS patients. 
However, that study included patients from 2014 to 2017 when older 
generation TAVR valves were being used, had a smaller sample size, 
high-risk patients were used as the comparison group, and the primary 
analysis was restricted to 30-day outcomes. In addition, TAVR numbers 
were growing, but it was not ubiquitous as low-risk indication was not 
approved. Our study expands this previous analysis by using more contemporary 
data (2015–22), a larger sample size of 5006 patients, only 
including the latest third- and fourth-generation balloon-expandable 
valve platforms, and using 1-year mortality as the primary outcome 
of interest. We used propensity score matching to identify if ‘shock’ itself 
was associated with worse outcomes. Propensity matching helped 
identify a high-risk group comparable in terms of co-morbidities and 
demographics thus providing a reasonable comparison. We found 
that the 30-day and 1-year mortality in the current analysis was lower 
than previously reported, which may reflect a better selection of patients 
undergoing TAVR, better procedural outcomes with the latest 
generation SAPIEN valves, and increasing operator experience and volume. 
Another key finding of the current study is that there was no difference 
in mortality between the CS and matched non-CS groups after 
the 30-day landmark analysis, compared to the previous analysishttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
that 
showed higher mortality after 30 days. Another study reported plateauing 
of mortality after 90 days from TAVR; however, it was limited 
by a small sample size of 180 patients.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
Thus, our landmark analysis 
suggests that mortality after 30 days is secondary to the patients’ co- 
morbidities and risk factors rather than CS prior to TAVR. It is critical 
to identify strategies to manage the shock component post-TAVR to 
achieve better long-term outcomes.

CS patients undergoing TAVR had significantly higher in-hospital, 
30-day, and 1-year mortality compared to the matched non-CS patients. 
One-year mortality in the present study was 29%, which is lower 
than the previously reported mortality rate of 35%–50% after TAVR in 
CS.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
In comparison, mortality was 50% in AS patients who were not 
surgical candidates and were managed medically,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
70% in patients who 
underwent BAV only for CS,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
50% in CS patients presenting with acute 
MI,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
and 35%–55% in CS patients with severe MR undergoing transcatheter 
edge-to-edge repair.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
These studies provide a reasonable indirect 
comparison suggesting that TAVR in CS may have better 
outcomes than these groups. If AS is the primary cause of obstructive 
CS resulting in low cardiac output and systemic perfusion, treating the 
cause can lead to rapid improvement in the clinical status of the patient. 
These patients are usually too sick for surgical intervention, so TAVR 
may be the only feasible option. As TAVR has become safer and 
more streamlined, earlier and faster intervention to relive obstructive 
shock in these patients may continue to improve outcomes.

In this cohort of CS patients undergoing TAVR, we found multiple 
risk factors that were independently associated with all-cause mortality 
at 1 year. None of the procedural or shock-related factors were predictive 
of long-term mortality consistent with the 30-day landmark analysis. 
For example MI within 30 days of TAVR was not associated with 
30-day or 1-year mortality in patients with CS undergoing TAVR. ESRD 
had the highest hazards of all the risk factors with a two-fold increase in 
risk of 1-year mortality. This is consistent with previous studies that reported 
a 1-year mortality of 37% in ESRD patients without CS.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
Thus, 
careful discussions and shared decision-making should happen in ESRD 


patients presenting with CS. Significant MR, significant TR, and LVEF 
were associated with 1-year mortality in the univariate analysis but became 
non-significant after multivariate adjustment. This signifies that 
the acute outcomes may be affected by other valvular disorders, but co- 
morbidities tend to determine the long-term outcomes.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
There was 
no difference in 1-year mortality between those with LVEF <20% or 
20%–40%, suggesting that very low EF should not be the only variable 
used in offering or denying TAVR in the setting of CS. In patients who 
survived, EF improved significantly during follow-up, and valvular regurgitation 
lesions improved. Patients undergoing ViV had a significantly 
lower 1-year mortality compared to those undergoing TAVR for native 
AS. Urgent and emergent TAVR can be performed with minimal or no 
contrast use because of the presence of a previous bioprosthetic 
valve, thus offering a quick bailout compared to patients with native 
AS. The median time from date of admission to TAVR in CS patients 
in the current study was 5 days reflecting some delay in intervention in 
these sick patients. To investigate this further, we examined if early 
TAVR would be associated with better outcomes in CS. TAVR within 
the first 5 days of admission was significantly associated with lower 
1-year mortality in univariate analysis; however, there was only a 
trend towards lower mortality after adjusting for co-morbidities 
and risk factors. Thus, it could be hypothesized that early work-up, 
consultation with the heart valve team, and intervention may benefit 
patients presenting in CS.

Among all the CS patients who underwent TAVR, approximately 
60% were discharged home, 20% went to an inpatient rehabilitation 
unit, and 8% were discharged to a nursing home. This is reassuring 
and reflects the need to include TAVR early in the treatment algorithm 
for the management of severe AS and CS. Once the obstructive component 
from AS is relieved, the majority of patients recover and 
rehabilitate almost completely to be discharged home. Patients who 
survived and followed at 1 year noted a significant improvement in their 
NYHA functional class with 88% reporting class I or II status. In addition, 
there was a marked improvement in their QoL as assessed by KCCQ 
scores which increased by 40 points from baseline to 30 days and 50 
points from baseline to 1 year. This implies that not only majority of

the patients were alive at 1 year, but they were doing quite well based 
on NYHA functional class and QoL KCCQ OS score improvements. 
Cardiac deaths accounted for 50% of all deaths at 30 days and 38% 
at 1 year signifying that majority of these patients die from non-cardiac 
comorbidities.

This study has important implications in the current era. With the 
growth of TAVR worldwide, increasing operator experience, better devices, 
and extension of indication into low-risk groups, it is important to 
remember that TAVR was originally evaluated and approved in patients 
who were at prohibitive risk of surgery in the PARTNER trial.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
TAVR led 
to a 20-point absolute reduction in all-cause mortality with a number 
needed to treat of 5 in that cohort. The rate of 1-year mortality in the 
current study is similar to the TAVR arm in the original trial; however, 
CS patients who are usually much sicker were not included in that trial. 
All TAVR trials to-date have excluded CS, and it is extremely difficult to 
conduct a randomized trial in AS patients with CS, so observational studies 
such as the current one can help guide treatment recommendations. 
The current European and US guidelines appropriately mention that 
TAVR should be offered to patients only if their expected survival 
from other co-morbidities is >1 year. Considering that 70% of the patients 
who present with CS prior to TAVR were alive at 1 year, CS by 
itself should not be considered a prohibitive factor. Other co-morbidities 
and risk factors predictive of higher mortality in this group can help select 
the appropriate patients for intervention. BAV has been evaluated extensively 
in the past for CS patients to facilitate recovery or to serve as a 
bridge to definite therapy in the future. However, studies have shown 
that the short-term and long-term mortality post-successful valvuloplasty 
remains very high.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
Our study shows that TAVR in CS patients was 
found to be safe with a low risk of major peri-procedural complications, 
highly effective with a close to 98% successful implant rate and low PVL 
rate, and was associated with >90% in-hospital survival in a traditionally 
morbid condition. As the peri-procedural risk of TAVR and BAV is similar, 
it seems that definitive therapy in terms of TAVR is more beneficial 
than BAV alone. Overall, this study confirms the safety and efficacy of 
TAVR in patients with CS and suggests that TAVR with new generation 
balloon-expandable valves may be offered to most patients who are anatomically 
suitable candidates, as long as active medical conditions such as 
sepsis, pneumonia, haemorrhage, cancer, or other issues preclude them 
from recovery or deriving any benefit.

Limitations

There are several limitations of the study. This is an observational study

offered TAVR due to futility. All the data are site-reported. This may 
lead to data entry and coding errors as the TVT-R-R definition of CS 
may not apply to all cases. The mortality rate of those that were entered 
as CS on TVT-R forms was similar to the CS patients on inotropes 
alone, suggesting that coding of CS by the sites was accurate 
in identifying patients with CS. As there is lack of haemodynamic data 
or lactate levels, we included the best possible measures in the definition 
of CS. The recently published Society for Cardiovascular 
Angiography and Interventions shock stage classification defines classic 
CS (stage C) as a patient who manifests with hypoperfusion and who 
requires one intervention (pharmacological or mechanical) beyond volume 
resuscitation. These patients typically present with relative hypotension 
(but hypotension is not required).http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
Based on this, use of 
positive inotropes or MCS device prior to TAVR would classify patients 
as CS and were included the CS definition. Furthermore, we excluded 
same-day elective TAVR procedures who may have been inadvertently 
labelled as CS as explained in the ‘Methods’ section (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
). PCI was performed in 30% of the CS patients 
who presented with MI within 30 days of TAVR as per the operator 
discretion. As the registry did not collect data on completeness of revascularization, 
its effect on outcomes cannot be determined. This 
study only included balloon-expandable valves, so the outcomes cannot 
be extrapolated to self-expanding valves. The follow-up is based 
on the TVT-R-R only as Medicare linkage is not available currently. 
Complete 1-year follow-up was available in 76% patients, which is 
similar to the previously published TVT-R-R-based studies.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data

,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad387#supplementary-data
Although there was no significant difference in the missingness of 
data between the CS and non-CS groups, we cannot be certain that 
this did not affect the overall results. All patients were censored at 
the time of last follow-up. Lastly, multiple testing may have increased 
the risk of type I error.

Conclusions

This large observational real-world study demonstrates that TAVR 
can be performed safely and successfully in patients with CS with current 
generation balloon expandable S3 and S3U valves. Despite the 
high mortality associated with CS, > 90% of the patients survived 
the initial hospitalization, and the majority of these patients were alive 
at 1 year with a significant improvement in their QoL and functional 
status. Patients who survived the first 30 days after TAVR had similar 
mortality rates to those who were not in CS. TAVR should be considered 
as a definitive treatment in most patients in CS if they are anatomically 
suitable candidates and do not have prohibitive 
co-morbidities that would curtail long-term survival. Future efforts 
should be focused on timing and peri-TAVR management of shock 
to further improve outcomes.
