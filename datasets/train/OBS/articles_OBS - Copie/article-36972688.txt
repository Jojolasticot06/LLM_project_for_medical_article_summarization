Introduction

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major modifiable risk factor for mortality 
worldwide and leads to cerebrovascular diseases and dementia.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Observational and prospective studies, as well as randomised clinical trials 
of antihypertensive therapies, have demonstrated that hypertension may 
be causally associated with impaired cognitive performance.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
At the 
same time, increased BP causes long-term changes in the brain.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
While the associations between BP and cognition may be mediated by 
alterations within cerebral structures and traits,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
the causal nature 
and exact mechanisms of these associations have been challenging to ascertain. 
Therefore, it is of primary clinical importance to identify specific 
brain areas mediating BP-dependent cognitive changes. Emerging genetic 
tools may enable this, as cognitive function is heritable; shares a common 
genetic variation with various brain imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs), 
including parameters describing cortical and subcortical regions; and 
may be affected by early life factors.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
While randomised trials remain 
the state-of-the-art approach to infer causality between various clinical 
traits,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
causal inference approaches employing genetic instrumental 
variables through Mendelian randomisation (MR) sit at the interface of 
experimental and observational studies.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
At the same time, the increasing 
number of well-powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
facilitates the identification of genetic proxies for complex phenotypes, 
such as BP and cognitive function, that can be used for MR analysis as 
both exposures and outcomes. More importantly, these may provide unique 
tools to indicate specific structures and functional phenotypes of the 
brain that can mediate this relationship.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Identifying such IDPs may 
define novel radiomic predictors of cognitive impairment in hypertensive 
subjects. It will also specify candidate brain regions for subsequent molecular 
and cellular therapeutic targeting.

Accordingly, we designed a triangulation approach to identify brain 
structures potentially responsible for the effects of BP on cognitive 
function. Firstly, we comprehensively mapped brain structures potentially 
influenced by BP in midlife using MR analysis. Secondly, we 
elucidated the effects of BP on cognitive function in well-powered datasets. 
Finally, using MR analysis, we identified structures in the brain 
that accompany the detrimental effects of elevated BP on cognitive 
function in humans. The pattern of brain damage linked to BP by genetic 
causal inference methods was then validated in an independent, well- 
phenotyped, prospectively recruited cohort.

Methods

Univariable and multivariable Mendelian 
randomisation analyses testing the effect 
of BP indices on cognitive function and brain 
imaging-derived phenotypes

Uncorrelated (r2 < 0.2), instrumental variables associated with BP traits 
were selected from 885 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
) replicated in one-stage or two-stage 
analyses in GWAS on BP indices by Evangelou and colleagues,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
similar to 
previous studies.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
Estimates of effects of the above SNPs on BP were 
extracted from the meta-analysis of the UK Biobank and International 
Consortium for Blood Pressure (ICBP) [n = 757 601, systolic BP (SBP), diastolic 
BP (DBP), and pulse pressure (PP) analyses adjusted for body mass 
index (BMI) and antihypertensive medication use in both the UK Biobank 
and ICBP].http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
Genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10-8) SNPs were extracted, 
and palindromic SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) > 0.4 or 
SNPs with MAF <0.05 were excluded (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
).

Summary statistics for each of the 3935 brain IDPs were derived from 
the GWAS of Smith and colleagues, including ~33 000 UK Biobank participants,
http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
and used as an outcome in MR analyses. Brain IDPs were named 
according to the original nomenclature.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
In order to avoid use of reverse- 
causal instruments, all SNPs with a significantly larger variation explained in 
the outcome compared with exposure trait (nominal P < 0.05 in Steiger’s 
testhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
) were excluded from this analysis. Since brain IDPs strongly correlate 
with each other,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
we used a false discovery rate (FDR) P < 0.05 threshold 
for inverse variance–weighted (IVW) method using instrumental variables 
from the ICBP + UK Biobank meta-analysis to identify IDPs significantly affected 
by BP. These IDPs had to additionally demonstrate a nominally significant 
(P < 0.05) association with BP when (i) using the weighted 
median, MR–Egger and robust IVW sensitivity methods, which allowed relaxing 
certain assumptions, such as lack of genetic pleiotropy,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
of the MR 
framework, and (ii) instrumental variables from separate ICBP and UK 
Biobank cohorts were used in IVW MR analysis.

Genome-wide association study performed by Lee and colleagues, encompassing 
257 841subjects from the UK Biobank and COGENT consortia,
http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
was used as a source of genetic estimates of the effect of selected 
SNPs on cognitive function. Mendelian randomisation analyses of the impact 
of BP indices on cognitive function included SNPs with a more significant 
effect on the exposure compared with outcome (nominal P < 0.05 in 
Steiger’s testhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Univariable and multivariable (i.e. testing effects of SBP, 
while adjusting for DBP and vice versa) two-sample MR analyses were performed 
using IVW method as well as sensitivity methods including weighted 
median, MR–Egger, and robust IVW methods.

Additional sensitivity analyses used the genetic estimates extracted from 
individual cohorts, i.e. ICBP (n = 299 024; SBP, DBP, and PP adjusted for 
BMI and antihypertensive medication use)http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
and UK Biobank [n = 340 
159; only SBP and DBP from the Neale lab analysis (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank/
) were used without adjusting for BMI; BP values were not adjusted 
for antihypertensive medication use]. These analyses are essential to 
acknowledge the possible impact of collider effects potentially caused by 
BMI and antihypertensive medication adjustments, both lacking in the UK 
Biobank–only BP GWAS, as well as moderate subject overlap (lacking in 
the ICBP-only MR analysis) in the primary MR analysis involving the ICBP 
+ UK Biobank dataset. Since sensitivity analyses were less powered due 
to three to five times lower number of instrumental variables (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
), we used a nominal significance level 
(P < 0.05 for IVW method) to retain IDPs affected by BP genetically defined 
by ICBP- and UK Biobank–only instruments.

(See http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
, for additional details on MR 
and rationale for control MR analyses concerning APOE locus, LDL-C level, 
and cognitive function.)

Mendelian randomisation analyses testing 
the effect of selected brain imaging-derived 
phenotypes on cognitive function

To test the effect of selected IDPs on cognitive function, we used uncorrelated 
(r2 < 0.2) SNPs associated with individual brain IDPs (significance 
threshold P < 3.16 × 10-8 set as previously described in a discovery UK 
Biobank sample of ~22 000 subjectshttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
) and replicated at the nominal level 
of significance P < 0.05 in an independent sample of ~11 000 UK Biobank 
participants.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
The meta-analysishttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
of both the above samples yielded genetic 
estimates used for subsequent MR analyses. In case SNPs were missing 
in the cognitive function GWAS, the best proxy (r2 > 0.8) was selected. All 
SNPs, selected as instrumental variables, were associated with selected 
brain IDPs at P < 3.16 × 10-8 (F-statistic > 10) and displayed a significantly 
larger effect on exposure compared with outcome (nominal P < 0.05 in 
Steiger’s testhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
).

UK Biobank study

The UK Biobank recruited 500 000 participants (aged 40–69 years) from 22 
assessment centres across the UK between 2006 and 2010.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
Baseline 


biological measurements were recorded, and touchscreen questionnaires 
were administered, as described elsewhere.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
The UK Biobank received 
ethical approval from the North-West Multi-Center Research Ethics 
Committee (11/NW/03 820). All participants gave written informed consent 
before enrolment in the study, which was conducted by the principles 
of the Declaration of Helsinki. Blood pressure measurement was 
performed twice for each participant present at baseline (2006–10) and imaging 
(2014–19) visits using a digital sphygmomanometer Omron 705 IT or 
a sphygmomanometer with an inflatable cuff in conjunction with a 
stethoscope (see https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/showcase/docs/Bloodpressure.pdf
for details). Brain imaging was performed at the imaging 
visit using Siemens Skyra 3 T scanner according to a protocol (https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ukbiobank/protocol/
and https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf
) described previously in details.https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf
,https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf
Cognitive 
function was defined as a fluid intelligence score (UK Biobank field ID: 
20016), i.e. an unweighted sum of the number of correct answers given 
to the 13 fluid intelligence questions, and assessed at baseline, imaging, 
and first repeat imaging visits. Of note, this variable demonstrates a significant, 
negative genetic correlation with SBP and DBP (r = -0.14, P = 3.42 × 
10-10/r = -0.16, P = 2.68 × 10-14, respectively) in the UK Biobank (Neale 
lab calculations available at https://ukbb-rg.hail.is/rg_browser/
), which may 
suggest shared genetic background of these traits. Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation 
prior to attending the baseline visit was assessed using the UK 
Biobank field ID 131350.

Genetic analyses identify brain structures related to blood pressure and cognitive impairment 2117

Baseline data from a prospective cohort and 
case–control study

Hypertensive and normotensive subjects were prospectively recruited between 
November 2014 and December 2020 in the Heart and Brain research 
programme at IRCCS Neuromed (NCT03986957) and as part of 
a case–control study (NCT02310217). Baseline visit data from both studies 
were analysed. (See http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
, for details concerning 
recruitment, BP measurement, cognitive function assessment, and 
brain magnetic resonance imaging in this cohort).

Testing the observational association between 
BP indices, cognitive performance, and brain 
imaging-derived phenotypes

Since GWAS on BP performed by the UK Biobank and ICBP included subjects 
of European ancestry,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
based on self-reported ethnicity, we selected 
white, British participants of the UK Biobank study to assess the association 
between BP, cognitive function, and brain IDPs. An average of two automated, 
sitting BP readings, with no adjustment for BP-lowering medication 
use, was calculated at the baseline and imaging visits and used in the final 
analyses, while subjects with only one reading available were excluded. 
We did not exclude any UK Biobank subjects based on their disease history. 
Association between BP traits and cognitive function was tested at the baseline 
visit in the UK Biobank (2006–10, n = 138 602) using univariate general 
linear model (GLM). Associations between selected brain IDPs and BP indices 
or cognitive function were tested using data from the imaging visit 
(2014–19) and the multivariate GLM model. All GLM models included 
sex, age, and BMI set as covariates. The longitudinal analysis tested the effect 
of IDPs, assessed at the imaging visit, on the difference between the fluid 
intelligence score assessed at first repeat imaging (2019+) and imaging visits 
divided by the number of days between those visits. The effects of smoking 
status and alcohol intake frequency were investigated in separate models. 
Brain volumetric IDPs were scaled for the T1-based head size scaling factor. 
All brain IDPs were de-confounded by four technical imaging confounders 
related to scanner position. In order to obtain effect estimates in standard 
deviation units and approximate normal distribution, dependent and 
independent variables were transformed to normal scores. Similar analyses 
were performed in the observational prospective cohort study. 
Observational mediation analysis was performed using the R mediation 
package (ver. 4.5)http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
with BMI, sex, and age used as covariates.

Results

Effects of blood pressure on 3935 brain 
imaging-derived phenotypes

Mendelian randomisation utilises random segregation of alleles at gametogenesis 
and uses genetic polymorphisms as instrumental variables to 
estimate the effect of exposure on the outcome. Since BP highly correlates 
with brain IDPs in observational analyses,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
we investigated relationships 
between BP and brain IDPs by performing MR analysis, 
testing the effects of SBP, DBP, and PP on each of the 3935 brain 
IDPs (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). A total of 242, 
168, and 68 brain IDPs, including primarily diffusion-weighted IDPs, 
volumetric, as well as resting-state functional IDPs, was significantly associated 
with SBP, DBP, and PP, respectively (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Importantly, all the above associations remained 
significant at nominal P < 0.05 for any of the leave-one-out IVW MR 
analyses performed. SBP is significantly associated with the highest 
number of brain IDPs, compared with other BP indices, with a positive 
effect on the volume of specific brain structures and the mean diffusivity 
in diffusion-weighted IDPs and a negative effect on fractional anisotropy–
related IDPs (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). 
Sensitivity analyses, performed separately in either ICBP or UK 
Biobank population, demonstrated a high correlation between MR estimates 
derived from various exposure BP GWAS (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
, and http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
, 
for comparison of IVW MR estimates calculated using genetic exposures 
derived separately from the UK Biobank and ICBP datasets). 
Moreover, IVW causal estimates obtained for 242, 168, and 68 brain 
IDPs associated with SBP, DBP, and PP, respectively, were slightly inflated 
for ICBP cohort–only analysis compared with meta-analysis of 
ICBP and UK Biobank (on average by a factor of 1.47, 1.26, and 1.53, 
respectively) or UK Biobank–only analysis [1.35 (SBP) and 1.24 
(DBP)]. Causal estimates were less inflated in the UK Biobank–only analysis 
compared with the meta-analysis of the ICBP and UK Biobank 
[1.09 (SBP) and 1.02 (DBP)].

Most of the associations identified using genetic tools were consistent 
with the results from the observational analysis at the imaging visit in 
the UK Biobank (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
), including 33 volumetric IDPs associated 
with one of the BP parameters analysed (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
), as 95%/91%/ 
82% of genetically SBP/DBP/PP–linked brain IDPs associated with SBP/ 
DBP/PP in the observational analysis below Bonferroni-defined 
significance threshold (P < 0.05/3935, http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
, S6-S8). Further adjustment for smoking status and alcohol 
intake frequency did not substantially influence observational analyses. 
As expected, estimates from the univariable MR analyses 
testing IDPs in relation to SBP or DBP were positively correlated 
(http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
).

Multivariable MR identified much lower number of IDPs compared 
with univariable MR and demonstrated that SBP and DBP associated 
with 18 and 33 IDPs, respectively (FDR P < 0.05 for multivariable 
IVW and nominal P < 0.05 for multivariable weighted median and multivariable 
MR–Egger using instrumental variables from the ICBP + UK 


Biobank meta-analysis). These effects were independent of BMI/antihypertensive 
medication use adjustment and moderate subject overlap in 
exposure and outcome GWAS as they were also confirmed (nominal 
P < 0.05 for multivariable IVW method) in the separate ICBP or UK 
Biobank analysis (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). 
Surprisingly, the estimates derived from the multivariable MR analysis 
demonstrated their negative correlation, which suggests opposite, direct 
effects of SBP and DBP on some of the IDPs tested (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
); however, 
only 13 IDPs were significantly associated with both SBP and DBP 
with opposite direction of causal estimate (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). The above change of correlation pattern was observed 
for analyses restricted to the UK Biobank or ICBP only (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Overall, 336 IDPs associated 
with either of the BP parameters, analysed in univariable or multivariable 
MR, were identified (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). 
These were mostly consistent with the findings from observational analysis 
(http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
and http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
).

Differential effects of blood pressure 
parameters on cognitive performance

In the next stage of analysis, we aimed to place the effects of BP on IDPs 
in the context of the effects of individual BP parameters on cognitive 
function. Interestingly, MR analysis, using SNPs derived from the UK 
Biobank and ICBP meta-analysis as instrumental variables for BP, identified 
a negative effect of SBP (-0.044 standard deviation (SD); 95% 
confidence interval (CI) -0.066, -0.021) and PP, but not of DBP, on 
cognitive function using the IVW method with consistent effect estimates 
across sensitivity methods, i.e. weighted median, robust IVW, 
and MR–Egger (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Importantly, leave-one-out IVW analysis 
found that this association was not artificially inflated by any of the 
individual SNPs. Additional analyses performed separately in the ICBP 
or UK Biobank cohort, aimed to control for potential bias caused by 
a subject overlap in exposure and outcome GWAS and by BMI/antihypertensive 
medication use adjustment, confirmed the magnitude and 
the direction of causal estimates (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
).

Interestingly, a multivariable MR analysis showed that the direct effect 
of SBP on cognitive function, independent of DBP, was more pronounced 
than the effect obtained from the univariable MR analysis 
(-0.087 SD; 95% CI -0.132, -0.042, Figure 2A). At the same time, 
the independent impact of higher DBP on cognitive function was protective, 
after adjusting for SBP (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Again, the same effect in multivariable 
MR analysis, compared with univariable MR analysis, was observed 
when the analysis was performed separately in ICBP or UK Biobank cohort 
(see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). The above findings 
were supported by observational analysis, which revealed a 
significant association of SBP and PP, but not DBP with cognitive function 
in the UK Biobank (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Moreover, when the damaging effect 
of SBP was taken into account in a single GLM model, higher DBP was 
associated with better cognitive performance (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
), and these associations 
remained robust to adjustment for smoking status, alcohol intake 
frequency, and the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. We observed significant 
effects of SBP, particularly in people over 50 years of age, while in younger 
subjects, SBP and DBP appeared to have adverse effects on cognitive 
function (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
).

Additional sensitivity analyses further validated genetically predicted cognitive 
function,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
used in the current MR analyses. The genetically instrumented 
level of LDL cholesterol, used as a negative control exposure, 
showed no significant effect on cognitive function, irrespective of inclusion 
of SNPs from the APOE locus (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). On 
the other hand, the rs429358 variant, constituting major genetic risk factor

with poorer cognitive function (B = -0.017 SD, SE = 0.004, P = 3 ×

as defined in the current study, does capture at least part of the spectrum 
of cognitive domains that can be affected later in life by dementia.

Identification of brain imaging-derived 
phenotypes that associate with cognitive 
function and are linked to blood pressure

We next investigated the relationship between IDPs and cognitive 
function, focusing on IDPs that were identified as genetically and observationally 
linked to BP. An observational analysis confirmed that the majority 
of IDPs related to BP was associated with cognitive function, at 
FDR-corrected P < 0.05, and additional adjustment for smoking status 
and alcohol intake frequency did not substantially influence these results. 
These IDPs cover predominantly diffusion-weighted parameters 
with variable strength of association with SBP (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). 
Importantly, the direction of estimates was predominantly opposite 
to the association with a particular BP index (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
and http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
for SBP and http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
) and remained 
significant (FDR P < 0.05, http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
) for 138 brain IDPs following additional adjustment for SBP. 
To provide additional evidence that these IDPs may accompany adverse 
effects of BP on cognitive function, we estimated the effects of these 
IDPs on cognitive function by performing MR analyses. To narrow 
down analysis to the most reliably instrumented candidates, we identified 
119, 29, and 7 IDPs, altered by SBP, PP, or SBP/DBP in multivariable 
MR analysis, with at least 3 uncorrelated instrumental variables available, 
respectively. This analysis has identified a total of 10 unique 
IDPs, including 9 related to SBP, that was associated with cognitive function 
(FDR-corrected P < 0.05 using IVW method; see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
, for all MR results concerning IDPs 
with at least 1 IV available). These IDPs included parameters related 
to putamen as well as white matter tracts such as the anterior corona 
radiata, anterior thalamic radiation, or anterior limb of the internal capsule 
(http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Inspection of leave-one-out IVW plots of the nine 
SBP-associated IDPs, potentially related to cognitive function, revealed 
that rs13107325 SNP from the solute carrier family 39 member 8 
(SLC39A8) locus had a predominant impact on IVW estimates concerning 
two putamen IDPs. In comparison, the strength of association of 
two brain IDPs concerning superior longitudinal fasciculus and anterior 
limb of internal capsule got attenuated to P = 0.06 after exclusion of 
single SNP (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Notably, except 
for two IDPs related to the putamen and one related to the anterior 
thalamic radiation, six remaining IDPs demonstrated association with 
SBP below the stricter Bonferroni-defined significance threshold using 
the weighted median MR approach.

Associations concerning individual IDPs could be confirmed in an observational 
analysis either directly (IDPs concerning putamen or anterior 
limb of the internal capsule) or indirectly using different IDPs related 
to the same brain structure (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Notably, a significant negative correlation exists between 
genetic estimates of cognitive function, SBP, and the nine IDPs identified 
(http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Additionally, using UK Biobank data, we analysed the effects 
of 9 brain IDPs (quantified at imaging visit) on the longitudinal change of 
fluid intelligence score in 2054 subjects between imaging and first repeat 
imaging visits. We found nominally significant adverse effects of 
IDPs related to the anterior thalamic radiation (right hemisphere) 
and anterior corona radiata (left hemisphere) on the change of fluid intelligence 
score (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). This 
further supports their role as potential mediators of detrimental effects 
of SBP on cognitive function, making these IDPs a potential target for 
pharmacological therapy of cognitive impairment in hypertension.

Validation in an observational prospective 
cohort and case–control study

As discussed above, genetic and observational analyses using the UK 
Biobank and ICBP cohorts identified 242 brain IDPs genetically linked 
to SBP which were concomitantly associated with cognitive function 
(http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). To replicate and translate our findings into clinically relevant 
setting, we tested selected IDPs for association with SBP or Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment score–defined cognitive function in a cohort of 
116 prospectively recruited, well-phenotyped hypertensive and 
normotensive subjects (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). 
Since SBP associates with cognitive function and the largest number 
of IDPs, we focused subsequent validation on SBP-related IDPs. The 
standardised betas of the association between (i) SBP and IDPs and 
(ii) IDPs and cognitive function were compared between the UK 
Biobank cohort and baseline data from the prospective cohort and 
case–control study with (i) a strong (r = 0.67, P < 0.0001; http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
) 
and (ii) a moderate (r = 0.33, P < 0.0001, http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
) correlation, respectively, 
which demonstrates a translational potential of our UK 
Biobank–based findings into clinically relevant subjects, in the context 
of SBP-induced brain changes quantified with magnetic resonance imaging. 
The latter moderate correlation may be explained by a difference 
in cognitive function, estimated as fluid intelligence in the UK Biobank 
cohort or Montreal Cognitive Assessment score in the prospective cohort 
and case–control study. Despite this, the top principal component, 
calculated using loadings of 30 IDPs (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
), related to structures genetically influencing cognitive function 
in the UK Biobank and available in the observational prospective 
cohort and case–control study, significantly correlated with Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment score in the two latter studies (r = -0.192, 
P = 0.039) and fluid intelligence score in the UK Biobank (r = -0.069, 
P < 0.001), where it mediated 7.4% (95% CI 2.9%–15.0%) of the total 
effect of SBP on fluid intelligence score. This additionally supports a 
translational perspective of our findings in the context of BP-induced 
changes of cognitive function that are mediated by specific IDPs. The 
association of 21 brain IDPs with SBP was directly replicated at FDR 
P < 0.1, while the anterior thalamic radiation tract, present among 9 
brain IDPs genetically associated with cognitive function in the UK 
Biobank, demonstrated the most robust association with Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment score in the observational prospective cohort 
and case–control study (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
and http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
).

Discussion

Using a triangulation approach based on combined observational and 
genetic causal inference approaches, we found an effect of BP on cognitive 
function and identified, for the first time, a set of specific brain 
structures that potentially respond to differences in SBP among 3935 
brain IDPs (see the Structured Graphical Abstract). Some of these structures, 
including putamen and the white matter regions spanning between 
the anterior corona radiata, anterior thalamic radiation, and 
anterior limb of the internal capsule, may represent the target brain regions 
at which SBP acts on cognitive function. We then leveraged the 
data obtained from a prospectively recruited cohort and case–control 


study to confirm the identified pattern of damage linked by genetic instruments 
to SBP.

Genetic analyses identify brain structures related to blood pressure and cognitive impairment 2121

While previous attempts to identify brain IDPs linked to BP were observational,

,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
we demonstrate a relationship between BP and a 
specific set of IDPs using genetic causal inference methods. These include 
the anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus, 
and the forceps minor tractshttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
as well as total volume of white matter 
hyperintensities previously suggested both observationallyhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
and in 
MR.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
However, contrary to observational analysis, we found no 
evidence of the genetic association between total volume of white 
matter hyperintensities and cognitive function. While white matter hyperintensities 
have been previously linked to dementiahttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
or 
Alzheimer’s disease but not to general cognitive function,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
our results 
may suggest that the effect of BP on cognitive performance may be 
mediated by specific white matter tracts, making the absolute total 
brain quantification of white matter hyperintensities a less sensitive indicator 
for this association in hypertension. For example, the external 
capsule, anterior corona radiata, and anterior thalamic radiation are 
strongly linked to SBP and associate with cognitive function, as evidenced 
by the MR analysis. Noteworthy, the two latter tracts are additionally 
associated with longitudinal change in cognitive function in 
2054 UK Biobank subjects. While the level of cognitive function in a 
particular timepoint may be a derivative of various factors, the exact, 
overtime route of the effect of brain IDPs, including those identified 
in the current study, on cognitive function should be validated in the future 
sufficiently powered longitudinal cohort studies. Furthermore, putamen 
has been identified as one of the key brain structures linked to 
both SBP and cognitive function in observational and genetic analyses.

visit in the UK Biobank are depicted on a scatter plot (A). After the exclusion of 38 potential outlier points (Betacognitive function > 0 and BetaSBP < 0), the 
correlation coefficient was r = -0.37, yet retaining statistical significance (P = 5.6 × 10-8). Mendelian randomisation estimates linking nine IDPs, affecting 
cognitive function in MR analysis at FDR P < 0.05, to SBP or cognitive function are presented on panel (B) (MD, mean diffusivity; ISOVF, isotropic or free

Importantly, our validation cohort study illustrated a similar pattern 
of SBP effects on key brain IDPs in a relatively small sample of hypertensive 
and normotensive subjects in whom no conventional radiological 
damage was evident in clinical routine magnetic resonance imaging, 
and we were able to directly translate the pattern of main features of 
cerebral injury associated with cognitive function from genetic 
association to the hypertensive and normotensive subjects. This is important 
as it suggests that these may serve as prodromic indicators of 
ongoing cerebral damage due to elevated BP. Further validation of this 
important finding will require focused large-scale magnetic resonance 
imaging studies in hypertensive subjects.

Another interesting conclusion arising from the current study is 
that structural changes in the brain occur mainly in response to the 
difference between SBP and DBP. Most volumetric IDPs were

associated with PP and mutually adjusted SBP and DBP in the multivariable 
MR analysis. At the same time, we identified several resting- 
state functional IDPs potentially responding to SBP or DBP rather 
than to PP. Observationally, BP-associated resting-state functional 
IDPs were associated with cognitive function. However, this observation 
was not supported by the MR approach. This may be caused by 
low number of good genetic instruments available for these IDPshttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
and by the intrinsic link between cerebral blood flow and blood oxygen 
level–dependent (BOLD) signal, with the latter that may be more 
linked to the cerebral haemodynamic alterations than inherited 
factors.

Genetic analyses identify brain structures related to blood pressure and cognitive impairment 2123

Finally, our study supports the existence of a modest, potentially causal, 
detrimental effect of higher SBP and PP, but not DBP, on cognitive 
performance in midlife, which may serve as additional evidence regarding 
the role of hypertension in dementias.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data

This is important in the 
context of the prevalence of hypertension. Since various forms of dementia 
may create a continuum spectrum rather than a strict dichotomy 
between Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data

to evaluate the complexity of this pathological condition.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
Previous MR 
studies linking BP to the cognitive function provided conflicting results, 
likely due to different sets of SNPs used as instrumental variables for BP 
indices.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
Our study included a much larger set of BP-specific instrumental 
variables derived from the UK Biobank and ICBP 
meta-analysishttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
and used more powered GWAS on the cognitive function.
http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
The null effect of DBP on cognitive function observed in the univariable 
analysis is intriguing, as higher DBP became protective after 
adjusting for SBP. Taken together with the opposite effect of SBP 
and DBP on many IDPs identified in multivariable MR analysis, this 
may reflect the impact of arterial stiffening on increased pulsatility in 
the brain microvasculature with increased penetration of forward 
and backward travelling pressure waveshttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
as previously associated 
with white matter hyperintensities.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data


Several limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. 
Most of the MR analyses performed were characterised by minor 
overlap of subjects in exposure and outcome GWAS. While analyses 
linking BP indices to brain IDPs and IDPs to cognitive function were 
characterised by a relatively small (<10%) subject overlap, this was 
not the case for a major analysis linking BP (instrumental variables derived 
from the meta-analysis of the UK Biobank and ICBPhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
) to 
cognitive performance (instrumental variables and genetic estimates 
derived from GWAS performed in the UK Biobank and 
COGENThttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
). Nevertheless, effect estimates linking BP to cognitive 
function were consistent across MR methods and different exposure 
GWAS used in the current study. Our study was primarily performed 
using middle-aged subjects from the UK Biobank; thus, extrapolating 
the results to older subjects, particularly at risk for dementia, is challenging. 
Since it was demonstrated that early-onset, rather than late-onset, 
hypertension predisposes to cognitive impairment in the later life,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
we 
may speculate that lifetime exposure to elevated BP, as assumed by an 
MR approach, plays a major role in the impairment of brain function, 
even in older people. Another limitation that should be noted is the 
modest number of subjects in IDP GWAS (~33 000) and thus a relatively 
small number, or even lack, of genetic instruments available for 
specific IDPs.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad101#supplementary-data
While multiple levels of evidence support the association 
of certain IDPs with BP or cognitive function, false positive associations 
may have arisen due to the multiple tests performed. In 
contrast to observational studies, MR-based causal inference should 
not be affected by confounding factors and reverse causality, although 
less likely owing to the careful selection of genetic instruments, cannot 
be entirely excluded. All the above emphasise the need for further epidemiological 
characterisation of BP–IDPs–cognitive function axis, and

In summary, this is the first study comprehensively, genetically, and observationally 
to link BP parameters, IDPs, and cognitive function. While 
cognitive function and volumetric IDPs seem to be related predominantly 
to SBP and PP, SBP associates with several IDPs that further display genetic 
effects on cognitive function and may serve as novel diagnostic and 
therapeutic targets in hypertension associated cognitive impairment.
