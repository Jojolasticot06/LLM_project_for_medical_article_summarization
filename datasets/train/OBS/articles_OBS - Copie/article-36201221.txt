Introduction
Septal deviation has been associated with respiratory problems, epistaxis, sinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea in both adults and children.1-4 Although surgical correction of the deviated nasal septum via septoplasty has been shown to be safe and effective in adults, pediatric septoplasties remain controversial.4-8 Historically, this controversy stems in part from concern that the repair of septal deviation in pediatric patients could impact facial growth, an idea that has largely been based on older animal studies investigating the role of trauma and surgery on growth disruption.9-13 Thus, practice patterns for pediatric septoplasty have often been more conservative with indications limited to severe pathology including septal hematoma, severe deformity related to trauma, or cleft lip and nose.4,13,14

However, over the past few decades, several studies have found that nasal surgery is not significantly associated with nasal growth, giving surgeons more confidence to operate on the pediatric population.4,15-20 For example, Tasca and Compadretti16 followed pediatric patients for a mean of 12 years and found that nasal surgery had no overall negative effects on nasal development. With the growing body of evidence demonstrating the safety and efficacy of septoplasty in children, this procedure is being performed with increasing frequency for expanded indications.15-19

Unfortunately, like all other surgical procedures, pediatric septoplasties are not immune to the need for revision surgery, with studies reporting revision rates from 4% to 20%.4-6,21 A recent nationwide study by Youn et al22 found that septoplasty revision rates are low in the adult population, but the literature on pediatric revisions remain sparse, with the vast majority of studies originating from single institutions. In addition, the sample sizes in these studies are inadequate to capture the complex interaction that exists throughout medicine between various factors such as age, sex, region, insurance status, number of revisions, and outcomes.23-30 Thus, we aimed to identify septoplasty revision rates in the pediatric population, along with factors associated with higher risk for revisions. We hypothesized that compared with adults, the pediatric population would have an increased septoplasty revision rate.

Methods
This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted using the IBM MarketScan Research Database,31 which contains inpatient and outpatient data from more than 20 million patients and their dependents who are covered under employer-sponsored private health insurance in the US.22 Data access was provided through the Stanford Center for Population Health Sciences. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Stanford University and was determined to be exempt from review because all data collected from the database were deidentified.

Patients aged 65 years or younger who received a septoplasty without nasal vestibular stenosis, rhinoplasty, or a costal cartilage graft as determined by the Current Procedural Terminology codes (eTable 2 in the Supplement) were included in the study. Individuals aged 18 years or younger were classified as pediatric patients, and individuals aged 19 to 65 years were classified as adults. The adult cohort was used as a comparison group for the pediatric cohort. Among those who received a septoplasty, patients were included in the revision septoplasty cohort if they received a second surgery including septoplasty, nasal vestibular stenosis, or rhinoplasty with or without a costal cartilage graft (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The first 12 Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to identify patients for the initial and revision surgery. Medical claims from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016, were available through our institution. However, we examined a subset of the claims where the initial septoplasty had taken place between January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2013, to allow for a minimum of 3-year follow-up time for revision surgery, with the maximum follow-up time being 10 years. Patients who did not meet the inclusion criteria for the first surgery or had key sociodemographic variables missing were excluded.

Because some insurance plan types had cell sizes smaller than 16, they were collapsed with other plan types so analyses could be conducted without having to remove data. We recategorized insurance data in the following ways: Comprehensive, exclusive provider organization, and high-deductible health plan were grouped together as “other,” and point-of-service (POS) and POS with capitation were grouped together as “POS + POS with capitation” owing to similarities in plan types. Health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), and consumer-directed health plan insurance plans were included as is. We categorized individuals aged 18 years or younger into 3 pediatric categories: younger than 8 years, 9 to 13 years, and 14 to 18 years. As in the study conducted by van der Heijden et al,8 these cutoffs were chosen because age 13 to 14 years is around the time when boys and girls complete their nasofacial growth spurt. Furthermore, children younger than 8 years were grouped into 1 category because our data access policy precludes us from publishing results for cell sizes smaller than 16.

Statistical Analysis
The main outcome of our study was the revision rate of pediatric septoplasty, and the secondary outcome was the septoplasty-to-septorhinoplasty conversion rate. Univariate analyses were conducted for sociodemographic variables between surgical cohorts. Continuous and categorical variables were tested for the magnitude of the differences using appropriate effect size metrics, and 95% CIs were used to describe the precision of the estimates. The associations between these sociodemographic variables and the rate of pediatric septoplasty revision were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed between January 1 and July 30, 2022 using RStudio, version 1.4.1103 (R Foundation), with P < .05, calculated using 2-sided t tests and χ2 tests, set as the threshold for statistical significance.

Results
A total of 24 322 pediatric patients (mean [SD] age, 15.7 [2.5] years; 15 121 boys [62.2%] and 9201 girls [37.8%]) met the inclusion criteria for this study, of whom 704 (2.9%) received a revision septoplasty procedure. The adult cohort that was used for comparison consisted of 286 218 adult patients (mean [SD] age, 41.4 [12.2] years; 162 893 men [56.9%] and 123 325 women [43.1%]) who received a septoplasty. Within the adult cohort, 3081 patients (1.1%) received a revision septoplasty. Pediatric patients who underwent revision surgery were younger (mean [SD] age, 15.2 [2.7] years) than pediatric patients who did not undergo revision septoplasty (mean [SD] age, 15.7 [2.5] years) at the time of their initial procedure. The mean (SD) age at which a revision surgery occurred was 17.8 (3.0) years.

Among pediatric patients, the composition of the revision surgery cohort and no revision surgery cohort differed by age, insurance plan, and region (Table 1). The distribution of age in the revision surgery cohort (704 patients) and no revision surgery cohort (23 618 patients), respectively, are as follows: 8 years or younger (22 [3.1%] for revision surgery vs 586 [2.5%] for no revision surgery; difference, 0.6% [95% CI, −0.7% to 1.9%]), 9 to 13 years (118 [16.8%] vs 2645 [11.2%]; difference, 5.6% [95% CI, 2.8% to 8.4%]), and 14 to 18 years (564 [80.1%] vs 20 387 [86.3%]; difference, 6.2% [95% CI, 3.2% to 9.2%]). There was a small difference in sex composition, with the revision surgery cohort having 281 girls [39.9%] and the no revision surgery cohort having 8920 girls [37.8%], for a difference of 2.1% (95% CI, −1.6% to 5.8%). For insurance, the greatest difference between revision surgery cohort and no revision surgery cohort was found in the PPO (452 [64.2%] for revision surgery vs 16 135 [68.3%] for no revision surgery; difference, 4.1% [95% CI, 0.5% to 7.7%]) and HMO (108 [15.3%] vs 2951 [12.5%]; difference, 2.8% [95% CI, 0.1% to 5.5%]) plan types. Smaller differences were found with other insurance plan types, which are shown in Table 1. The distribution of the regions in the revision surgery cohort and no revision surgery cohort, respectively, are as follows: South, 271 patients (38.5%) for revision surgery vs 9362 (39.6%) for no revision surgery (difference, 1.1% [95% CI, −4.8% to 2.5%]); Northeast, 125 patients (17.8%) vs 3514 (14.9%) (difference, 2.9% [95% CI, 0.0% to 5.8%]); Midwest, 140 patients (19.9%) vs 6191 (26.2%) (difference, 6.3% [95% CI, 3.3% to 9.3%]); and West, 168 patients (23.9%) vs 4551 (19.3%) (difference, 4.6% [95% CI, −1.4% to 7.8%]).

Primary and Secondary Outcomes
Within the pediatric cohort, 704 patients (2.9%) received a revision surgery, of whom 66 (9.4%) received a rhinoplasty for the revision procedure. The mean (SD) age at initial septoplasty for children who converted to a rhinoplasty was 15.3 (2.4) years compared with 15.2 (2.8) years for those who did not. In terms of sex, 36 patients who converted to rhinoplasty were female (54.6%), compared with 245 (38.4%) in the nonrhinoplasty revision group (difference, 16.2%; 95% CI, 9.8% to 22.6%).

Among the adult revision surgery cohort, 162 of 3081 patients (5.3%) received a rhinoplasty for the revision procedure. The adult revision cohort had a mean (SD) age of 37.4 (13.2) years. Whereas the pediatric revision cohort receiving a rhinoplasty was 54.6% female, the adult cohort comprised 90 women (55.5%), which is a 0.9% (95% CI, −6.4% to 8.2%) difference.

Analyses of the Pediatric Population
Within the overall pediatric cohort, univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess for risk factors associated with increased rates of revision (Table 1). Compared with patients aged 14 to 18 years (564 revisions among 20 951 patients [2.7%]), those 8 years or younger (22 revisions among 608 patients [3.6%]) and those aged 9 to 13 years (118 revisions among 2763 patients [4.3%]) had higher rates for revision surgery. The revision rates by sex were similar (Table 2). Within insurance plan types, the HMO (108 of 3059 [3.5%]), POS + POS with capitation (77 of 2078 [3.7%]), and consumer-directed health plan (39 of 1070 [3.6%]) groups all had slightly greater revision rates than the PPO group (452 of 16 587 [2.7%]) as well as the overall revision rate for children (2.9%). When comparing regions, the Northeast (125 of 3639 [3.4%]) and West (168 of 4719 [3.6%]) had slightly higher revision rates than the South (271 of 9633 [2.8%]) and the Midwest (140 of 6331 [2.2%]).

In addition, the pediatric revision septoplasty cohort was stratified by sex, and univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to identify differences between sex cohorts. Although we did not find any clinically significant differences, these results can be found in eTable 1 in the Supplement.

Pediatric Population vs Adult Population
The pediatric revision septoplasty cohort had a slightly smaller percentage of female patients than the adult revision septoplasty cohort, whereas other differences in distribution of sociodemographic factors were not clinically meaningful (Table 2). Overall, the pediatric cohort was found to have a higher rate for revision surgery (704 of 24 322 patients [2.9%]) than the adult cohort (3081 of 286 218 patients [1.1%]; difference, 1.8%; 95% CI, 1.6% to 1.9%). After categorizing the pediatric cohort into age groups, all of the age groups had higher rates of revision than the adult population (8 years or younger, 22 of 608 patients [3.6%]; 9 to 13 years, 118 of 2763 [4.3%]; and 14 to 18 years, 564 of 20 951 [2.7%], compared with 1.1% among adults).

Discussion
Our study is a large-scale analysis of pediatric septoplasty revisions across the US. When compared with the adult septoplasty population, pediatric patients as a whole were significantly more likely to receive a revision, with the highest odds in the 9- to 13-year-old age group. Patients in the West and Northeast along with patients who had POS and HMO health plans had higher odds of receiving a revision.

Whereas revision rates for pediatric septoplasty have ranged from 4% to 20% in previous studies,4-6,21 our study found the overall revision rate to be lower. One reason for this disparity, as Youn et al22 suggested while looking at adult septoplasties, is that differing surgical techniques have been shown to produce distinct revision rates. For example, studies have found the extracorporeal septoplasty approach to have higher revision rates than the standard endoscopic septoplasty approach.22,32,33 Another possible reason for disparate revision rates is that most of the previous studies were single-institutional studies and/or had very small sample sizes, which may not truly represent health trends on a national scale.4-7,21 Although rhinoplasties are not common in children, it is nevertheless important to note that the IBM MarketScan Commercial Database is based on insurance claims and does not include out-of-pocket rhinoplasties. This limitation may lead to an underestimation of our revision rate, which may not include teenagers who may have elected to receive rhinoplasties.22

Within the pediatric cohort, children aged 9 to 13 years had a higher risk for revision septoplasty compared with the other age brackets. In line with our study, Bishop et al6 found that children younger than 14 years had a significantly higher revision rate than children older than 14 years. Other studies looking at rhinoplasties and sinus surgery have found similar results.7,21 As the absolute indications for pediatric septoplasty are severe in nature, particularly significant nasal trauma, we hypothesize that sometimes 1 procedure may not be sufficient and revision surgery may be recommended.34 Furthermore, research has shown a greater incidence of high-impact nasal trauma in the age cohorts that had the highest rates of revision.35,36 Muñante-Cárdenas et al35 found that compared with children younger than 6 years, children older than 6 years are more likely to have higher-impact injuries from bicycle accidents, sports-related injuries, and violence, which may require subsequent procedures. Similarly, Perkins et al36 found that more than 50% of nasal fractures for children younger than 17 years were from sports-related injuries, notably baseball and softball. Thus, the severity of absolute indications and increased incidence of high-impact injuries can help explain the increased revision risk in the 9- to 13-year-old cohort.

Recent studies have shown that pediatric septoplasty is unlikely to have a long-term impact on pediatric facial development and thus indicate that septoplasties can be safely performed in children of all ages.16-20 There are even data to suggest that performing septal surgery in children with severe deviation may result in improved facial growth compared with watchful waiting until the child is older. However, clinicians should be aware that some studies suggest that certain surgical septoplasty techniques could impact long-term postsurgical nasal angles.6,16,30 For example, the study by Tasca et al16 suggests that patients treated with extracorporeal septoplasty had different nasolabial angles, whereas septoplasty using the endonasal approach did not interfere with nasal growth. One of the limitations of the current study is our inability to assess whether procedure type was associated with differences in revision rates. While septoplasty can be safely and effectively performed in children, our current study highlights the need to counsel parents about the potential need for revision surgery to achieve desired outcomes.

Our analysis also found geographic variations in revisions rates across the pediatric cohort, with higher rates in the Northeast and West. This variation may be partially explained by the fact that there are significantly more otolaryngologists in these regions, allowing for more operations and thus more revisions to be conducted.22,28,29 These findings also support another study that found increased revision risk for nasal surgery in the Northeast and West, which the researchers noted might be because patients in the Northeast are less likely to have high-deductible health plans that discourage revision procedures.22,27 Additionally, as is the case for adult septoplasty, there are currently no established clinical guidelines for pediatric septoplasty. Thus, as noted by Youn et al,22 there may be increased physician-to-physician variation in indications for surgery, which can greatly impact outcomes.

Another important finding was that patients on HMO and POS health plans were more likely to receive revision surgery. This finding of a higher rate of revision surgery for POS plans is similar to another study that found increased odds of revision in the POS and comprehensive insurance groups but did not find higher rates in the HMO group.22 The higher revision rates for POS and HMO plans may partially be attributed to the fact that POS and HMO plans facilitate lower out-of-pocket sharing and thus high health care utilization.22,27 Although the discrepancy in HMO findings with the study by Youn et al22 is not entirely understood, we hypothesize that it may be attributed partially to the differences in sample sizes between the studies. At the same time, it is important to consider the possible impact socioeconomic factors might have on increased revision rates in the pediatric HMO population. In 2021, Peltz et al26 found that Hispanic children and non-Hispanic Black children were significantly more likely to be enrolled in HMO plans compared with non-Hispanic White children. Although our analysis did not include race owing to database limitations, it is indisputable that minority populations face significant barriers in access to care as well as less favorable health outcomes.23-25,37 Although it is not possible to detect this complex interaction from our study, future studies should analyze the role of health inequity and race in outcomes for patients in the otolaryngologic setting.

Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, this is a retrospective cohort study that uses convenience sampling of data derived from insurance claims. Thus, we were unable to include individuals on public insurance, such as Medicaid or Medicare, which may shape the generalizability of our findings. Second, various events including death, a switch in insurance coverage, or a change in employer would lead to de-enrollment of patients in our database and would make it impossible to link with previous data. Additionally, we allowed for minimum and maximum follow-up times of 3 and 10 years, respectively; this time frame likely led to an underestimation of the lifetime revision risk, which may be especially pronounced in a pediatric cohort. Third, we were unable to study the role of race or socioeconomic status, as our database license does not include these variables. Additionally, the lack of granularity along with the study design did not allow us to tease apart the reasons or indications for the original surgery (ie, nasal trauma, congenital abnormality, septal hematoma), as the severity of the injury or condition may inherently increase the risk for revision surgery.

Finally, for observational studies of this nature, Grimes et al38 have recommended that only risk ratios from cohort studies that exceed 2 to 3 should be considered credible. As none of our odds ratio reached this magnitude, the findings of this study should be interpreted with caution especially in regard to the associations of revision surgery.

Conclusions
In this cohort study, we found an overall revision rate of 2.9% among pediatric patients who underwent septoplasty, with 10.5% of those undergoing revision surgery subsequently receiving rhinoplasty. Patients aged 9 to 13 years had the highest odds of receiving revision, and pediatric patients overall were more likely to undergo revision surgery than were adults. Although further research is needed to better identify the causes for revision pediatric septoplasty, our study provides valuable information that physicians and patients may use to inform clinical decision-making.
