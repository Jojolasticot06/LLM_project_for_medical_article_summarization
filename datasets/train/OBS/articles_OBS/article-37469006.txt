Introduction

The past decades have witnessed a shift in human 
morbidity characterized by the rise of non- 
communicable diseases with phenotypes ranging 
from allergic, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases 
to obesity.1 The World Health Organization 
recognized obesity as a global epidemic in 1997.2 
Acceleration of the obesity epidemic with comorbidities 
is expected in the future since excessive 
weight gain is prevalent in children3 and in the 
population at reproductive age.4 The development 
of overweight and obesity in childhood is multifactorial 
but it is well established that maternal 
obesity markedly increases the risk for childhood 
obesity.5 Given that obesity in children is likely to 
persist into adulthood, a vicious cycle of intergenerational 
obesity development is likely to arise.6 
The primary cause of overweight and obesity is 
excessive intake of energy compared to expenditure. 
The obesity epidemic may to a large extent be 
attributed to changes in diet and a shift to a more 
sedentary lifestyle over the past decades. 
Interestingly, changes in the composition and 
function of the gut microbiota have also been 
linked to obesity.7 Intestinal microecology changes 
in response to an unhealthy diet, but aberrant gut 
microbiota composition has been reported already 
during infancy before the onset of overweight.8 In 
addition, experimental studies conducted using 
animal models suggest a causal role for the gut 
microbiota in the development of overweight and 
obesity through increased dietary energy harvest, 
changes in satiety and modulation of host 
metabolism.9 The gut microbiota may propagate 
inflammatory responses recognized to underlie 
overweight and obesity but may also act as 
a source of microbial stimuli which attenuate the 
chronic low-grade systemic inflammation.8,10–13

The hypothesized causal link between the gut 
microbiota and obesity development may in part 
be mediated through the production of metabolites 
such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which have 
multiple functions including regulation of energy 
metabolism and immune function and stabilization 
of gut barrier function.9 In line with this, low fecal 
concentrations of SCFAs have been detected in 
overweight as compared to normal weight 
children.14 Early interaction with microbial 
antigens and the establishment of an age and environment-
appropriate gut microbiota is thus anticipated 
to ensure normal growth and healthy 
development.8,13,15 The present study builds upon 
a unifying theory on these two parallel phenomena: 
the global increase in the prevalence of overweight 
and obesity,2 and the potential causal role of the gut 
microbiota in the obese state.16 To achieve 
a comprehensive characterization of the evolution 
of the gut microbiota in pregnant women over the 
course of the obesity epidemic, we investigated the 
gut microbiota composition and function in the 
third trimester of pregnancy in individuals with 
normal or high pre-pregnancy body mass index 
(BMI) in 1997, 2007 and 2017.

Results

Altogether 124 pregnant women (24 pregnant in 
1997, 76 in 2007 and 24 in 2017) were included in 
the study. Pre-pregnancy overweight was present 
in 41 subjects whilst 83 women were normal weight 
(Supplementary Figure S1). The baseline and pregnancy 
characteristics of the pregnant women are 
presented in Table 1. The time period (1997, 2007 
or 2017) followed by pre-pregnancy BMI group 
(pre-pregnancy BMI 18.5–24.9 or =25 kg/m2) and 
gestational weight gain were the most relevant factors 
contributing to the gut microbiota composition 
of pregnant women according to multivariate 
analysis of the microbial beta diversity based on the 
Bray-Curtis distance (Supplementary Figure S2a). 
When all study subjects were included in the analysis, 
statistically significant differences were 
detected in the gut microbiota profiles of pregnant 
women among the three time periods (permutational 
multivariate analysis of variance 
(PERMANOVA) Bray-Curtis R2 = 0.029, p = 
0.001) (Figure 1a). The observed differences were 
confirmed by multivariate canonical correspondence 
analysis (CCA) (F = 1.17, chi square = 0.34, 
p = 0.002; Figure 1b). The gut microbiota differences 
were reflected in alpha-diversity, as the pregnant 
women from 1997 exhibited higher microbial 
richness and diversity as measured by the Chao1 
and Shannon indices, respectively, as compared to 
the pregnant women from 2007 to 2017. In general, 
the microbial richness was significantly reduced 
over time from 1997 to 2017 (Figure 1c).

The phylum Firmicutes was enriched in the 
microbiota of pregnant women from 1997 (p 
< .001, q=<.001) compared to women from 2007 
to 2017. At genus level (Supplementary Figure 
S2b), the main differences were characterized by 
the higher abundance of several groups from the 
families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococaccaceae 
such as Lachnospira genus (p = 0.002, q = 0.043), 
Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group (p = 0.021, q = 
0.19), Lachnospiraceae_UCG-8 (p = <.001, q = 
0.022), UCG-10 (p = 0.004, q = 0.059), 
Faecalibacterium (p = 0.020, q = 0.190), 
Ruminococacceae UCG-002 (p = 0.002, q = 0.044) 
or unclassified Ruminococcaceae genera (p < .001, 
q = 0.022) in the gut microbiota of pregnant 
women from 1997 compared with those from 
2007 to 2017. In addition, the gut microbiota of 
women pregnant in 1997 was characterized by high 
relative abundance of Faecalibacterium and groups 
from Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae (most 
of them short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers), 
while in women pregnant in 2007 Streptococcus 
and Bifidobacterium were the predominant genera 
as assessed by LEfSe (Figure 1d). In 2017, the gut 
microbiota of pregnant women was characterized 
by the genera Bacteroides and Bilophila.

We next investigated the gut microbiota composition 
in the subgroups of normal weight and 
overweight pregnant women over the course of 
the study periods. A multivariate Maaslin analysis 
considering the study period and BMI group as 
factors revealed that the phylum Bacteroidetes (p 
= 0.005, q = 0.074), mainly due the genus 
Bacteroides (p = 0.008, q = 0.146), was more abundant 
in normal weight compared to overweight 
pregnant women (Supplementary Table S1). 
Multivariate CCA revealed also significant differences 
in the gut microbiota composition of pregnant 
women among the three time periods 
dependent on pre-pregnancy BMI (F = 1.06, chi 
square = 0.80, p = 0.004, Figure 1e). A clear distinction 
in the gut microbiota composition between 
normal weight and overweight women was manifest 
only in the 1997 population. Decreased gut 
microbiota richness was observed in overweight 
compared to normal weight women (p = 0.045) in 
1997 (Figure 1f) while no such difference was 
observed in 2007 or 2017.

Differences in gut microbiota activity as measured 
by fecal SCFA concentrations were observed 
among the whole population of pregnant women 
from different time periods (PERMANOVA 
Euclidean distances R2 = 0.185, p = 0.001). The differences 
were also confirmed by multivariate CCA 
(F = 2.19, chi square = 0.002, p = 0.037; Figure 2a). 
The total concentration of SCFAs was significantly

higher (p < .001) in the pregnant women in 1997 
compared to those in 2007 and 2017, mainly due to 
higher levels of acetate (p < .001) and butyrate (p 
< .001). When the relative abundances of each individual 
SCFA were corrected by the total SCFA 
production, the women pregnant in 1997 exhibited 
a trend for higher production of some minor metabolites 
such as caproic acid (p = 0.063) and valeric 
acid (p = 0.053) (Figure 2b). Higher levels of SCFA 
were associated with higher abundance of 
Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae members 
(Supplementary Figure S3). Genera from these 
families showed a positive relation with a rho ranging 
0.2–0.4 especially with minor SCFAs (IVA, 
VA and CA) while other genera such as 
Veillonella or Haemophilus were negatively correlated 
with those SCFA.

CCA models considering time period and BMI 
groups showed distinct fecal SCFA profiles (F = 
1.905, chi square = 0.0014, p = 0.029; Figure 2c) with

the time period emerging as the most significant 
factor (p = 0.025). Despite the higher levels of SCFA 
in 1997 and a significant decrease at later time periods, 
no significant differences were observed either in total 
SCFA levels or the concentrations of acetate, butyrate, 
and the rest of SCFAs between normal weight and 
overweight women.

Discussion

A decrease in intestinal microbiota richness and 
diversity over time was observed in the pregnant 
women investigated in 1997, 2007 and 2017. In 
addition, the fecal concentration of SCFAs, an indicator 
of gut microbiota function, was significantly 
higher in the women pregnant in 1997 as compared 
to the later time points. In the subjects pregnant in 
1997, distinct clustering of the gut microbiota composition 
was evident between normal weight and 
overweight women while no such differences were 
detected in 2007 or 2017. The gut microbiota of 
overweight and normal weight women in 2007 
resembled the gut microbiota of overweight 
women from 1997. The gut microbiota of pregnant 
women may thus have changed to a composition 
typical for overweight individuals.

The continuous global decline in biodiversity is 
a major threat facing modern humanity, but we are 
only beginning to understand its consequences on 
human health. Our direct interaction with nature is 
diminishing with the proliferation of the industrialized 
and urbanized lifestyle.17 The changes in our

external environment, resulting from the agricultural 
revolution, population growth and urbanization 
have begun millennia ago, but the velocity of 
lifestyle modernization and biodiversity decline 
have been unprecedently rapid over the past decades. 
Our results suggest that a parallel decline in 
microbial diversity has occurred in our internal 
environment during the last decades. Whether 
there is a causal link between reduced biodiversity 
in our external environment and the gut microbiota 
remains an open question, but there are data 
indicating that environmental exposures represent 
the driving force behind the differences in gut 
microbiota composition between individuals.18

The emergence of non-communicable disease 
(NCD) and obesity may be explained by reduced 
microbial contact resulting from changes in 
hygiene, medical practices, diet, living conditions 
and lifestyle.12 However, we lack direct evidence 
for the external microbial environment modulating 
the indigenous microbiota. The pregnant women 
investigated in the present study were all living in 
the same geographical area, with no obvious 
changes in population density or natural surroundings 
during the study period. The specific exposures 
underlying the observed compositional 
differences thus remain unknown. Previously, antibiotic 
use has been linked with both gut microbiota 
perturbations and increased prevalence of overweight 
and obesity.8,19 Interestingly, however, the 
use of all major groups of antibiotics has declined 
in Finland during recent years according to the 
Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (https:// 
urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-343-425-7). Data on 
antibiotic use before pregnancy by the women in 
the present study were unfortunately not available. 
The number of women exposed to antibiotics during 
pregnancy was similar among the time periods 
(Table 1). Diet is the most substantial modulator of 
the gut microbiota20 and changes in dietary practices 
may explain our results. According to 
a national longitudinal survey with data from the 
years 1997, 2007 and 2017, the intake of carbohydrates 
and particularly sucrose decreased in 
women in Finland while the intakes of fiber, protein, 
and fat increased.21 The consumption of red 
or processed meat, sugar sweetened drinks or 
candy remained at the same level. Previously published 
data from the present population indicate 
similar trends of increased protein and fiber intake 
but no changes in the amount or quality of consumed 
fat in pregnant women.22–24 The differences 
compared to non-pregnant women may be 
explained by the fact that the pregnant women 
received dietary guidance at prenatal visits and 
are likely to pay more attention to healthy eating 
habits.23,24

The changes observed in the gut microbiota 
composition and activity in pregnant women may 
have clinical significance. We have previously 
reported that the gut microbiota undergoes marked 
changes during the course of pregnancy along with 
the physiological weight gain and insulin resistance 
necessary for fetal growth.25 Reduced diversity and 
potential to induce adiposity and reduced insulin 
sensitivity in experimental animals was detected in 
the gut microbiota during the third trimester in 
comparison to early pregnancy.25 According to 
a recent report, the gut microbiota of women with 
pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity is characterized 
by lower diversity and functional changes as 
compared to that of normal weight women.26 The 
importance of these phenomena is underscored by 
data indicating that the development of gestational 
diabetes mellitus (GDM) is preceded by changes in 
gut microbiota composition and reduced concentration 
of fecal SCFAs.27 Fecal microbiota transplant 
using samples obtained during early 
pregnancy from women who later developed 
GDM to germ-free mice resulted in insulin resistance, 
which may be interpreted to suggest a causal 
role for the gut microbiota in the development of 
GDM. The health consequences of aberrant maternal 
gut microbiota may extend to the next generation. 
The mother provides the first and most 
important inoculum in the microbial colonization 
of the child and early infancy gut microbiota 
changes and reduced fecal SCFAs have been associated 
with obesity development.8,14 The altered 
maternal gut microbiota composition and function, 
including reduced production of SCFAs, 
may thus contribute to the intergenerational transfer 
of obesity as the aberrant microbiota and, consequently, 
the seeds for obesity development, are 
passed on to the offspring by different routes: during 
pregnancy, at delivery by the microbes in the 
birth canal, and close contact with the mother 
during breastfeeding.

Some women in our study had remained normal 
weight despite their microbiota resembling that of 
those who are overweight. This suggests that some 
individuals may harbor resilience factors protecting 
against the development of adverse outcomes. 
The increasing prevalence of chronic inflammatory 
disease and obesity have spawn interest in identifying 
microbial factors that could support healthier 
immune and metabolic development and reduce 
disease risk.28 The present study calls for more 
clinical research conceptualizing how the human 
microbiota is linked to disease risk, and specifically, 
a search for a microbiota profile as an indicator of 
the risk of adverse outcome in the child. These data 
would provide a basis for personalized nutrition 
solutions which, together with a healthy dietary 
intake, might benefit pregnant women and their 
children.

Our study has several limitations, which should be 
considered when interpreting the results. The 
number of subjects is relatively small and may 
prevent detecting subtle but significant differences 
in gut microbiota composition particularly in the 
subgroup analyses of normal weight and overweight 
women. Furthermore, the subjects were 
categorized to two groups based on pre- 
pregnancy BMI in an attempt to preserve statistical 
power. Categorizing individuals with overweight or 
obesity in the same group prevents the detection of 
potentially important differences between these 
BMI groups. As discussed above, data regarding 
diet or antibiotic use before pregnancy in the 
study subjects were not available. Even though the 
fecal samples were collected using a uniform protocol 
and the DNA extraction and sequencing were 
performed at the same time with the same protocol 
and equipment, the storage times varied considerably 
as per the study design, which may cause bias. 
However, we consider this unlikely particularly in 
the light of the present findings. Firstly, in a recent 
study, fecal and mucosal samples from a colorectal 
cancer biobank were stored at -80°C for a mean 
duration of five years. Samples stored for up to 
eight years were used and storage conditions had 
no significant influence on the results.29 Secondly, 
in the present study, no differences in DNA efficiency 
or concentrations were evident between the 
time periods and higher microbial richness and 
diversity was found in the older samples. 
Moreover, the differences between overweight 
and normal weight women from the same time 
period in 1997 could not have been caused by 
differences in storage time.

In parallel with the complex decline in biodiversity 
in our natural surroundings, a marked decrease 
in intestinal microbiota richness and diversity 
accompanied by functional changes has taken 
place in pregnant women over the course of two 
decades. The gut microbiota of pregnant women 
has changed toward a composition characteristic of 
overweight individuals. Determining the intergenerational 
transfer of obesity resulting from deviant 
initial microbiota to excessive weight gain or 
resilience will offer breakthroughs for key discoveries 
of next-generation personalized dietary 
interventions.

Materials and methods

Study participants and design

The study population consisted of pregnant women 
from a series of intervention studies with long-term 
follow-up conducted at the Turku University 
Hospital in Turku, Finland.30,31 Pregnant women 
recruited in 1997, 2007 and 2017 were eligible for 
the present study. The first inclusion criterion was 
availability of a fecal sample collected at 32 weeks of 
pregnancy prior to any microbiota-targeted interventions. 
The second criterion was that the information 
on accurate BMI was available before the 
pregnancy. These criteria were fulfilled by 59, 118 
and 31 women in 1997, 2007 and 2017, respectively. 
Next, pregnant women were divided into two 
groups based on pre-pregnancy BMI. BMIs between 
18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2 were considered to represent 
normal weight, while in overweight women BMI 
was greater or equal to 25 kg/m2. Women with 
obesity (BMI greater or equal to 30 kg/m2) were 
classified in the same category as those with overweight. 
Altogether 41 overweight women were 
identified (Table 1, Supplementary Figure 3) by 
one member of the research group not involved 
with the original intervention studies (TO). We 
then aimed to select two normal weight women 
from the same study period for each overweight 
woman by identifying women with their pre- 
pregnancy BMI representing the mean of the total 

population of normal weight women in the corresponding 
study period. On this basis, a total of 125 
pregnant women were included in the present 
study, of whom 41 were overweight and 83 normal 
weight (Table 1). One woman pregnant in 2017 was 
included in the microbiota analyses but excluded 
from those pertaining to BMI as the pre-pregnancy 
BMI could not be confirmed.

Ethics

The study was conducted in accordance with the 
Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and other relevant 
ethics guidelines and regulations. The original clinical 
studies were approved by the Ethics committee 
of the Hospital District of Southwest Finland. Oral 
and written informed consent was obtained from 
all subjects.

DNA extraction and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing

Total DNA was extracted from the fecal material 
(approx. 100 mg) using the automated assisted 
method based on magnetic beads (Maxwell® RSC 
Instrument coupled with Maxwell RSC Pure Food 
GMO and authentication kit, Promega, Spain) following 
the manufacturer’s instructions with previous 
treatments to improve the DNA extraction. 
In brief, samples were treated with lysozyme (20 
mg/mL) and mutanolysin (5 U/mL) for 60 min at 
37°C and a preliminary step of cell disruption with 
3-µm diameter glass beads during 1 min at 6 m/s by 
a bead beater FastPrep 24-5 G Homogenizer (MP 
Biomedicals). Purification of the DNA was performed 
using DNA Purification Kit (Macherey- 
Nagel, Duren, Germany) according to manufacturer’s 
instructions. DNA concentration was measured 
using Qubit® 2·0 Fluorometer (Life 
Technology, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for further 
analysis.

DNA libraries were constructed with the amplification 
of the V3-V4 variable region of the 16S 
rRNA gene as described previously.32 
A multiplexing step was conducted by the 
NextEra XT Index Kit (FC-131-2001) (Illumina, 
San Diego, CA, USA) and DNA quality of the 
library PCR product was measured by 
a Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip (Agilent 
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to verify the 
size; the expected size on a Bioanalyzer trace is 
~550 bp. The libraries were sequenced using was 
a 2 × 300 bp paired-end run on a Illumina platform 
(FISABIO sequencing service, Valencia, Spain) 
according to manufacturer instructions. Controls 
during DNA extraction and PCR amplification 
were also included and sequenced.

Computational and statistical analysis

Residual adaptors were removed from the raw 
sequences using Trimmomatic software.33 
A DADA2 pipeline was used to achieve quality 
filtering, sequence joining, and chimera 
removal.34 Taxonomic assignment was conducted 
using the Silva v132 database with the addition of 
the species level classification by the same 
database.35 Samples with less than 1000 reads 
were removed from the study. Resulted taxonomical 
tables were processed using phyloseq package36 
for further statistical analysis in Rstudio 
environment.37 Alpha diversity indexes were calculated 
using the mentioned package after rarefaction 
to the minimum reads (1052). Differences in alpha 
diversity index were assessed by Kruskal–Wallis 
test followed by post-hoc Dunn’s test with 
Benjamini–Hochberg correction for p-value 
adjustment. Beta diversity was studied based on 
the Bray-Curtis distance and permutational multivariate 
analysis of variance (Adonis test) was 
assessed to determine differences in the overall 
microbial community structure. These were also 
represented in canonical correspondence analysis 
(CCA) using several R packages including 
ggplots,38 ggordiplot,39 FactoMiner,40 and 
FactoExtra.41

Differential abundance of taxa was tested using 
Kruskal–Wallis test after CLR normalization with 
a false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment for multiple 
comparisons (referred as q in the text). 
A p-value <.05 and q < 0.2 were considered the 
statistical thresholds for significance. Linear discriminant 
analysis (LDA) effect sized (LEfSe) 
analysis42 was performed for the biomarker discovery 
using a size-effect cutoff of 2.0 on the logarithmic 
LDA score. All differential abundance test 
including Lefse analysis were performed using 
their specific functions form the 
MicrobiomeMarker package.43 To assess the 

potential impact of BMI on the pregnant microbiota, 
general lineal models were performed using 
Maaslin2 algorithm.44 The 16S rRNA gene 
sequence data generated is available through 
NCBI Sequence Read Archive Database under project 
accession number BioProject ID 
PRJNA844901.

Short Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) profiles

The short chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles were 
measured on fecal supernatant by GC- MS according 
to Eberhart et al.45 by use of a gas chromatography 
system Agilent GC 7890B - 5977B (Agilent 
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) fitted with 
a column DB- FATWAX, (30 m, 0 × 0.25 mm 
x 0.25 µm operated in split mode (20:1). The conditions 
were as follows: Oven temperature program: 
100°C for 3 min, ramped to 100°C at a rate 
of 5°C min-1, to 150°C for 1 min, to 200°C at a rate 
of 20°C min-1, and finally held at 200 for 5 min. 
Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 
mL min-1; inlet temperature of 250°C.

Differences in the concentration of each 
SCFA according to the time period were determined 
by Kruskal–Wallis test. A CCA was also 
assessed to study the associations between the 
production of each individual SCFA with the 
general pattern of the specific decade. Specific 
Spearman’s rank correlations between microbial 
genera and SCFA were obtained and built by 
use of gplots package46 after normalization of 
the microbiota data as relative abundance using 
the microbiome package.47
