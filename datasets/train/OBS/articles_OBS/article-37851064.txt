Introduction 

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a 
dysregulated host response to an infection [1]. The global 
burden of sepsis is estimated to be 49 million cases annually 
[2] of which half require intensive care unit (ICU) 
treatment [3]. Sepsis accounts for more than 11 million 
deaths [4], and significant long-term morbidity amongst 
survivors [5]. Despite progress in the understanding of 

sepsis pathophysiology, no specific treatment has proven 
successful [6, 7]. Amid calls for precision therapy, a 
greater understanding of the heterogeneity of sepsis is 
needed and a focus of clinicians, trialists, and funders [6, 
8–10]. 

Recent approaches to measure sepsis heterogeneity 
used unsupervised computational methods on clinical, 
biomarker or gene expression data from observational 
studies or clinical trial datasets. Examples include subtypes 
from the Sepsis Endotyping in Emergency Care 
(SENECA) study [11], acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) subphenotypes from the ARDSnet randomized 
trials [12, 13], and Molecular Diagnosis and Risk 
Stratification of Sepsis (MARS) and sepsis response signatures 
(SRS) endotypes based on transcriptomic data 
of whole blood leucocytes [14, 15]. At present, more 
than 100 sepsis subtypes are proposed, without awareness 
of overlap (or clinical implications), partly caused 
by the lack of data in a single cohort to compute each of 
the subtypes [16]. It is unknown whether each new subtype 
strategy is of added value for the patient or merely 
‘reinventing the wheel’, by being comparable to already 
existing subtypes. This is essential information to inform 
predictive enrichment in future trials [10]. 

To address this knowledge gap, we sought to determine 
the concordance (i.e., agreement) between different subtype 
labels, outcomes, and biologic pathways of critically 
ill sepsis patients classified by previously proposed sepsis 
subtyping methods. We hypothesized that subtype strategies 
derived from different data sources signify unrelated 
subtypes, due to the complex nature of sepsis and 
fundamental differences between clinical, biomarker, and 
transcriptomic data. However, we also hypothesized that 
partial overlap will be present in the subtypes with most 
unfavorable outcome, mainly driven by disease severity. 
Moreover, we hypothesized that concordance was high 
when subtypes were based on the same data source. 

Methods 

We used a prior systematic review [16] to identify candidate 
subtype labels for critically ill sepsis patients (supplemental 
Table E1). We chose four subtype strategies 
shown to be reproducible, associated with differential 
treatment effects in prior work [11, 17–20], and reflective 
of multiple domains. These are a mainly clinical 
based domain [11], a combination of clinical and biological 
domains [21] and a transcriptomic domain [14, 
15, 20]. To assign subtypes, we analyzed a previously 
selected cohort from the MARS study making use of 
clinical data, host response biomarkers, and transcriptomic 
data from whole blood leukocytes, all collected 
within 24 h after admission [14]. For each patient, a subtype 
label was applied for each of the four strategies. See

gene expression analysis. 

Study design, patients, and definitions 

The MARS cohort was a prospective observational study 
in the mixed ICUs of two tertiary teaching hospitals 
(Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam and University 
Medical Center in Utrecht) [14]. Consecutive patients 
above 18 years of age with an expected length of stay 
longer than 24 h admitted between January 2011 and January 
2014 were included via an opt-out method approved 
by the medical ethical committees of the participating 
hospitals [14]. We analyzed a previously defined cohort 
of patients fulfilling Sepsis-2 (and Sepsis-3) criteria at 
ICU admission in whom clinical, biomarker and transcriptomic 
data was available making it possible to determine 
at least 3 out of 4 subtypes. 

Sepsis subtype adjudication 

First, clinical characteristics were used to identify the 
SENECA subtypes a, ß, ., and d using the SENECA 
approach [11]. All clinical variables used for SENECA 
subtype derivation in SENECA were identified in the 
MARS cohort (supplemental Table E2). Then, subtypes 
were adjudicated by calculating the Euclidean distance 
from each patient to the centroid of each subtype from 
the SENECA derivation cohort [11]. 

To apply sepsis subtype labels based upon ARDS subphenotypes 
(termed ARDS subtypes “hyperinflammatory” 
and “hypoinflammatory”), we applied the 
previously published parsimonious model using plasma 
levels of bicarbonate, interleukin-8 (IL-8), and protein C 
[21]. 

To identify MARS and SRS subtypes, we used labels 
developed from whole blood leukocyte RNA expression. 
For MARS subtype adjudication, the original classification, 
which used consensus clustering method in 
the discovery cohort and a sepsis endotype classifier in 
the validation cohort, was applied [14]. SRS 1 or 2 was 
classified by applying the SepstratifieR method [22] using 
a previously derived 7-gene signature [23], with default 
parameters. For more information on subtype adjudication, 
see online supplementary methods. 

Statistical analysis 

We analyzed multiple domains of the sepsis subtypes; 

(i) reproducibility and clinical characteristics, (ii) concordance 
of subtype membership, (iii) biologic pathways 
of subtypes implicated through plasma protein 
biomarkers and whole blood leukocyte gene expression 
profiles, and (iv) development of subtype ensembles by 
adjudicating multiple subtypes to a single patient and, 
thus, creating subsets of patients. 
First, the reproducibility and clinical characteristics 
of subtypes compared to the original studies was 
assessed. The overall distribution of the specific subtype, 
clinical characteristics, and outcomes (e.g., inhospital 
mortality) were measured. Second, to study 
concordance between different subtype labels, proportions, 
alluvial plots and Cramer’s V, corrected for bias, 
were used. Cramer’s V is a measure of the strength 
of association between different subtype labels and 
was characterized as follows: 0–0.1 no association, 
0.1–0.3 weak association, 0.3–0.5 moderate association, 
and > 0.5 strong association [24]. Third, biological 
domains of subtypes were described by plasma protein 
biomarker concentration on admission. Furthermore, 
whole blood leukocyte gene expression data were used 
to determine differentially expressed genes and to identify 
canonical signaling pathways in each subtype using 
Reactome database (R software package, reactome. 
db version 1.82) [25, 26]. Fourth, explorative analysis 
of subsets of patients was performed by identifying 
groups of patients with most subtype overlap, determined 
by (1) association strength, (2) overlapping biological 
pathways, and (3) = 
10 patients. Each enriched 
subset, called sepsis ensemble, was then compared as a 
“new subtype of multiple subtypes”. 

In all analyses, a Mann–Whitney U or a Kruskal– 
Wallis test was used to analyze continuous nonparametric 
data, presented as median and interquartile 
ranges (IQR). Continuous parametric data, presented as 
means ± 
standard deviation (SD), were analyzed using a 
Student’s t test or analysis of variance when appropriate. 
Post hoc testing was performed using Dunn’s test 
of multiple comparisons using rank sums for nonparametric 
continuous data, a Tukey post hoc testing for 
parametric continuous data and a Bonferroni correction 
for categorical variables. Categorical data, presented 
as numbers (percentages), were analyzed using 
a chi-square test. All data were analyzed using R studio 
built under R version 4.0.3 (R Core Team 2013, Vienna, 
Austria). A P value < 0.05 was considered to be of statistical 
significance. 

Results 

Patients 

Among 8332 patients in the MARS study, 2499 patients 
were admitted with sepsis and 522 patients had the possibility 
to adjudicate at least 3 out of 4 subtypes. Mean 
age was 61.2 years (SD 14.6), male sex was most common 
(n= 
297, 56.9%) and the median sequential organ 
failure assessment (SOFA) score was 7 (IQR [5–9]) on 
ICU admission. Patients were commonly mechanically 
ventilated in the first 24 h of ICU admission (n= 
421, 
80.7%) and in-hospital mortality rate was 30.1% 
(Table 1). Nearly half (n= 
226, 43.3%) were admitted 
with a pulmonary infection, while abdominal infections 
were less common (n= 
130, 25%). 

Reproducibility and clinical characteristics of sepsis 
subtypes 

After SENECA subtype adjudication using the SENECA 
approach in this critically ill cohort, 316 patients were 
classified as . (60.5%), 188 as d (36%), 12 as ß (2.3%), and 
6 as a (1.1%). The distribution of subtypes, especially a 
and ß, was different from the original SENECA cohort 
(supplemental Fig. 1). The patterns of clinical data and 
host response were reproduced in the .- and d-type (supplemental 
Table 3). For example, .-type patients had 
higher markers of inflammation, with the highest C-reactive 
protein (CRP) levels (169 mg/L [87–267], p= 
0.007) 
and core temperature (38.2 (1.1) °C, p= 
0.001). d-type 
patients had the most abnormal cardiovascular, liver 
function and hemodynamic markers, and highest inhospital 
mortality (n= 
82 (43.6%), p< 0.001) compared to 
other subtypes (supplemental Table 3). 

For ARDS subtypes, more patients were adjudicated to 
the hypoinflammatory subtype (59.9%) than to the hyperinflammatory 
subtype (40.1%) (supplemental Table 4). 
Patients classified as hyperinflammatory showed higher 
SOFA scores (9 [7–11] vs 6 [4–8], p< 0.001) and higher 
levels of CRP on admission (180 mg/mL [99–273] versus 
138 mg/mL [62–234], p= 
0.009). Markers reflective of 
cardiovascular and hemodynamic aberrations were more 
abnormal in the hyperinflammatory group with lower 
bicarbonate, increased heartrate, increased serum lactate 
and lower systolic blood pressure (supplemental Table 4, 
p= 
< 0.001–0.002). The hyperinflammatory subtype 
showed increased mortality compared to hypoinflammatory 
(37.5% vs 19.7%, p< 0.001). 

Two transcriptomic labels were used to classify sep-
sis patients using whole blood RNA expression profiles. 
First, patients were adjudicated to the MARS subtypes, 
identical to the original discovery and validation cohort 
(supplemental Table 5, [14]). SRS subtypes yielded similar 
distributions as the original derivation cohort (SRS1 
45.6% vs 40.7%). Similar as previously reported and

(5.6) vs 21.5 mEq/L (6.1), p< 0.001) in SRS1. However, 
there was no significant mortality difference between 
the SRS subtypes in the MARS cohort (supplemental 
Table 6). 
Concordance between subtypes 

There was no relationship between any of the subtyping 
approaches (Fig. 1, supplemental Table 7–8). For example, 
when comparing SENECA versus ARDS subtypes, 
71.3% of .-type patients were classified as hypoinflammatory. 
Meanwhile, of the d-type patients, 64% were 
classified as hyperinflammatory resulting in a moderate 
association between the SENECA and ARDS strategies 
(Cramer’s V= 
0.366). The clinical characteristics 
of .-type were similar to those classified as hypoinflammatory, 
as well as the 30-day mortality (supplemental 
Figs. 2–3, supplemental Table 3–4). 

When comparing SENECA vs. MARS and SRS labels, 
d-type patients were mostly distributed amongst Mars1 
and Mars2 patients and the majority of .-type patients 
were classified as Mars2. This suggests a weak association 
between the two approaches (Cramer’s V= 
0.091). 
The same weak association was true for the SRS subtype 
labels (Cramer’s V= 
0.086). Subsequently, clinical characteristics 
classified by SENECA subtypes showed no clear 
relation to clinical characteristics classified by MARS or 
SRS subtypes (Table 1, supplemental Fig. 2, supplemental 
Table 3, 5–6). Only d-type patients and Mars1 appeared 
to have similar survival rates (supplemental Fig. 3). 

Fig. 1 Distribution of SENECA, ARDS, MARS, or SRS subtypes across each other in the MARS cohort. Visualization of concordance between subtype 
labels with alluvial plots in patients with sepsis in the MARS cohort 

When comparing ARDS subtypes vs. MARS and SRS 
subtypes, a moderate association between the strategies 
was found (Fig. 1, Cramer’s V=0.351–0.382). The hypoinflammatory 
patients were most comparable with Mars3 
(36.9%) and/or SRS2 (69.5%), which agrees with the clinical 
characteristics (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 2). 

When comparing MARS and SRS labels, almost all 
Mars3 patients were classified as SRS2 (90.7%). However, 
the remaining transcriptomic labels showed little concordance 
resulting in a moderate association (Fig. 1, Cramer’s 
V=0.456). 

Relationship between subtyping strategies and plasma 
protein biomarkers and immune cell gene expression 
mechanistic pathway analysis 

Among 466 patients with measured host response 
biomarkers (89% of the cohort, Fig. 2, supplemental 

Table 9–12), we observed that inflammation mark-
ers were most elevated in d, hyperinflammatory, Mars2 
and SRS1. However, the hyperinflammatory ARDS subtype 
was significantly different from all other subtypes 
(p< 0.01). In line with the distribution between subtypes, 
the hypoinflammatory subtype was most similar 
to .-type, Mars3 and SRS2 (p= 
0.001–0.439). Coagulation 
markers, including D-dimer and antithrombin, and 
endothelial cell activation markers, including angiopoietin 
and fractalkine, were most abnormal in d-type, hyperinflammatory, 
Mars2, and SRS1, although almost all 
subtypes showed similar concentrations. Overall, Mars2 
and SRS1 were most comparable in biomarker levels 
across all subtypes in all domains (p= 
0.079–0.424). 

There were substantial alterations in blood leukocyte 
gene expression among all sepsis subtypes compared to 
healthy controls. Yet, only few genes were specific within

each subtype label (supplemental Figs. 4, 5). When comparing 
subtypes, d-type and Mars1 shared the most 
unique genes (supplemental Figs. 6, 7). Pathway analysis 
confirmed previously implicated mechanisms [14, 
15]. For example, downregulation in major pathways in 
the adaptive and innate immune system were observed 
in Mars1 and SRS2 (Fig. 3), but also in the d-type and 
hyperinflammatory subtype. Pathways involved in hemostasis 
were mostly not significant, whereas metabolism 
pathways were overexpressed and similar in the hyperinflammatory 
and Mars2 subtypes. 

Sepsis ensembles 

In an exploratory analysis among 64 possible subtype 
combinations, 17 ensembles contained at least 10 patients 
(supplemental Fig. 8), with membership ranging from 
10 to 65 patients (median 20, IQR 15). These ensembles 
varied in characteristics and outcome, and were dependent 
on the combination of subtyping approaches (Fig. 4, 

supplemental Fig. 9). For example, hospital mortality 
ranged from 8% to 46% as the Mars subtype changed 
from Mars4 to Mars1, according to whether that patient 
also belonged to .-type, hypoinflammatory and SRS1. 
In another example, although not significantly, endothelial 
markers and mortality decreased as the SRS subtype 
changed in combination with d-type, hyperinflammatory 
and Mars2, but not when combined with Mars1 (supplemental 
Fig. 9). 

Discussion 

In this secondary analysis of the MARS prospective 
cohort study, we describe a comparison of sepsis subtypes, 
based on clinical, biomarker or transcriptomic 
data in critically ill patients with sepsis. Subtypes could 
be assigned successfully, but the distribution of the SENECA 
subtypes and mortality in SRS subtypes was notably 
different from the original cohorts. Concordance

Canonical signaling pathways were grouped into major pathways, indicated in bold 

was moderate to low, concluding that a different set of 
patients was identified in each subtype strategy. Host 
response biomarkers and transcriptomic data showed the 
most similarity between Mars2 and SRS1. When patients 
were assigned multiple subtypes, this created subgroups 
of patient with a broad variability in characteristics and 
in-hospital mortality. 

Compared to prior reports, SENECA subtypes of sepsis 
were similar in their clinical characteristics [11]. However, 
the distribution of the SENECA subtypes in this 
critically ill population was different from those reported 
in the original Emergency Department (ED) population. 
For example, the rates of a and ß were < 10%, far lower 
than 20–30% in broader study cohorts. Even though the 
distribution of SENECA subtypes was dependent on case 
mix differences, the clinical characteristics of the individual 
SENECA subtype members were consistent with 
prior work [11]. Notably, we found no clear relation-
ship between the distribution of SENECA subtypes nor 
clinical characteristics with any of the transcriptomic 
subtypes. For example, we did not observe concordance 
between d patients and Mars1, even though both 
subtypes tend toward higher organ dysfunction and 
greater mortality, which was not in line with our hypothesis. 
However, host response biomarker aberrations were 
most similar between .-type and Mars4, and to a lesser 
extent between d-type and Mars2. This could be driven 
in part by disease severity, as d-type and Mars2 had the 
highest SOFA score. 

The most overlap in the distribution of sepsis subtypes 
was between subtype strategies derived from the same 
data source (MARS and SRS subtypes). In addition, there 

was also a moderate association between ARDS subtypes 
and all other subtypes. In the absence of concordance 
between clinical and molecular classifiers, it may be that 
biomarkers form a key link between clinical and transcriptomic 
approaches to subtyping sepsis. Furthermore, 
biologic subtypes also show a difference in gene expression 
profiles and prior work has shown that SENECA 
subtypes are modifiable when new biomarker data is 
added [27, 28]. Although there is no ground truth to subtype 
labels or gold standard to compare, the inclusion of 
biologic features such as plasma protein biomarkers may 
be feasible, and unveil subtypes suitable for evaluation in 
clinical trials [29]. 

These findings suggest that multiple subtype strategies 
reflect different, perhaps complimentary pieces to 
the subtyping story. Similar work in traumatic injury 
and oncology reveals that combinations of clinical, biomarker, 
and transcriptomic subtypes will reveal important 
ensembles, however small, that are prognostic or 
predictive of treatment response and have added value 
compared to a single subtype [30, 31]. As a proposed 
solution to investigate the complimentary nature of the 
subtypes, we explored sepsis subtype ensembles as combinations. 
In our exploratory analysis and the examples 
given, we show that combining subtypes seem to give a 
more precise estimate of the outcome compared to a single 
subtype. Nevertheless, there are many challenges with 
this approach. First, this stratification approach requires 
large sample sizes. Dividing the homogeneous subgroups 
into more homogeneous subgroups will quickly lead 
to loss of power and low-grade evidence if the sample 
size is not adjusted. Second, feasibility of acquiring the

subtypes is important. Considering a bed-side approach, 
it could be more realistic to identify SENECA subtypes 
over ARDS or MARS and SRS subtypes, regarding the 
time and effort that it costs. However, routinely available 
clinical variables only indirectly reflect the underlying 
injury process and biomarker data is essential in identifying 
subtypes with heterogeneity of treatment effect 
[32]. Third, as data layers increase, so does the need for 
dimension reduction, to encounter overlap, duplicity and 
overfitting. In this study, the .-type is, amongst others, 
characterized by high clinical inflammatory markers such 
as CRP and an upregulated immune system in the transcriptomic 
data; however, host response inflammatory 
biomarkers such as IL-6 and IL-8 are lower compared to 
the d-type. This indicates a mismatch in the data relation-
ship, creating a challenge in the integration of omics and 
non-omics data. In the long run, the ultimate goal should 
be the same for every method: to stratify patients into 

more homogenous subsets with an identifiable and verifiable 
treatable trait [33]. Taken together, the ensembles 
explored here demonstrate feasibility of existing subtype 
labels to jointly identify unique patients. It is unknown 
though how these subsets will identify treatable traits. 

This study has several limitations. First, SENECA subtypes 
were applied using a reduced feature set compared 
to the original work [11]. This limitation is previously 
shown to have modest, if any, impact on classification 
and subtype characteristics. Second, the prospective 
enrollment of the MARS population occurred prior to 
updated clinical practice guidelines and this analysis is 
performed in a single cohort. This could limit generalizability. 
Third, not all published sepsis subtypes were feasible 
to include in this analysis. We selected four highly 
cited approaches that reflected different features, analytic 
methods, and were potentially linked to treatment. 
Fourth, this result may not apply to low-income and 

middle-income countries or patients cared for in non-
ICU settings. 

Conclusion 

Among critically ill patients with sepsis, subtype strategies 
using clinical, biomarker, and transcriptomic data 
do not identify comparable patient populations and are 
likely to reflect disparate clinical characteristics and 
underlying biology.
