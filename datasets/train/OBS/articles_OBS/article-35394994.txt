INTRODUCTION 
Since its declaration by the World Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on November 26, 2021, a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant of concern called (B.1.1.529)1,2 was first detected in South Africa. This variant of concern has experienced rapid expansion and was estimated to be 81% of the variants isolated by November 2021 and 95% isolated by December 2021. In fact, Omicron was the most predominant variant of the sixth wave in Spain.3 Accumulating scientific evidence supports the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant and its greater immune escape capacity, as well as lower virulence and lower risk of causing severe disease and death than previous variants.4 This study aimed to analyze the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on liver transplantation in the current wave from late November 2021 through February 23, 2022. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS 
This retrospective observational study included 355 liver transplant recipients (LTRs) from La Rioja and Cantabria undergoing regular follow-up at the Liver Transplant Unit of the Marqués de Valdecilla University Hospital and the Hepatology Unit of San Pedro Hospital. Clinical data, including comorbidities and immunosuppressive regimen, were obtained from patient’s medical records. Epidemiological and clinical information, including contact details, date onset, clinical severity, and disease course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, was gained via telephone survey. This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Cantabria (Code 2022.038) and complied with the provisions of the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. The humoral response was evaluated using serum levels of anti–SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 immunoglobulin (Abbott SARS-CoV-2 antispike immunoglobulin G II assay, positive >50 AU/mL), and serum levels of anti–SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 immunoglobulin of ≥4160 AU/mL were chosen as surrogate measures of antibody neutralization.5 Categorical variables were expressed as the number of cases (percentage), and continuous variables were expressed as the median (interquartile range [IQR]). RESULTS In the current sixth wave, more LTRs have been found to be infected than the sum of the 5 previous waves (30 versus 16 LTRs; Figure Figure1).1). Table Table11 shows the characteristics of these patients. Of these 30 LTRs, 29 were full vaccinated (96.6%) and received a third dose of Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine between September 20, 2021, and December 27, 2021, in a median of 96 d (IQR, 87–111) before the diagnosis of the infection (from December 2, 2021, to February 17, 2022). It is noteworthy that the infection was asymptomatic in 8 LTRs (24%), the symptoms were mild in 21 LTRs (70%), and only 1 patient required hospitalization for pneumonia and finally died. The most common symptoms were cough (36.6%) and runny/stuffy nose (36.6%), followed by headache (23.3%), myalgia (20%), and fatigue (16.6%) with a mean duration of 4.6 d (IQR, 2.5–7). Whereas in the nonvaccinated patient, these symptoms were accompanied by fever, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In a subgroup of 19 LTRs, we had the results of the humoral response in a median of 107 d (IQR, 93.75–119) after the third vaccine dose. Paradoxically, we observed in the LTRs with lower anti-S1 antibody titers (<4160 U/mL) more asymptomatic patients (4/8; 50%) than in the group of LTRs with a stronger humoral response (2/11; 18.1%), suggesting the possibility that LTRs developed cellular response capable of preventing or limiting severe coronavirus disease 2019 symptoms.6 In contrast, of the 16 LTRs infected in the previous waves, 5 (31.25%) required hospital admission for pneumonia, and 2 of them (12.5%) died. In this sixth wave, intrafamilial transmission (17/30; 56.6%) was the main route of infection, and nosocomial transmission was demonstrated in 2 LTRs (6.6%). In 16 LTRs (53.3%), the initial diagnosis was made by a rapid antigen self-test taken at home7,8 and subsequently confirmed by antigen test or by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, performed with nasopharyngeal swab in primary care centers. The outpatient follow-up protocol was similar to that of patients without any risk factors: without sending any patient to the hospital, neither performing blood tests nor chest radiology. In fact, only 12 LTRs (40%) contacted the Liver Transplant Unit.  
DISCUSSION 
In our series, the route of transmission was mainly intrafamilial, although we also observed nosocomial transmission because of the high rate of community transmission of the virus in this wave. It is noteworthy that asymptomatic cases represented 56.6% of all infected LTRs, percentage higher than reported by the Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in Spain study performed in the last months of the first wave in Spain.9 Additionally, we confirmed that in this sixth wave, there is a greater transmissibility of the infection with a lower risk of producing serious illness in LTRs. This may be because of the practically universal vaccination with 3 vaccine doses of the LTRs together with the lower virulence of the Omicron variant. These findings together with those reported from South Africa, United Kingdom, and Canada, are consistent with experimental animal infection that Omicron causes less severe disease in mice and hamsters.
