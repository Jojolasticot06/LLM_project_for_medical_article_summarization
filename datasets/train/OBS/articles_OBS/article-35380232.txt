Introduction 

Under normal physiological conditions, the glycolytic hexokinase 
pathway metabolises cerebral glucose via brain-specific 
hexokinase isoforms [1]. However, during hyperglycaemia, 
some glucose bypasses glycolysis and is isomerised to polyols 
via the polyol pathway [2], in which aldose reductase first 
metabolises glucose to the polyol sorbitol, and subsequently 
sorbitol dehydrogenase oxidises sorbitol to fructose (Fig. 1). 

Polyols are cyto-and neurotoxic [3, 4], and excessive 
polyol concentrations may lead to nephro-[5], retino-[6] 
and polyneuropathy [7], with sorbitol and fructose playing 
crucial roles. Sorbitol has an osmotic potential because of 
limited permeability through cell membranes, and reduces 
the ability of cells to protect themselves from the influence 
of reactive oxygen species [3]. Fructose can damage 
proteins through irreversible glycation and formation of 

AGEs [4]. Polyols in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), through 
the formation of AGEs, non-enzymatic glycation of 
myelin or oxidative damage/stress, may also play a role 
in the development of white matter lesions and cognitive 
impairment [8–10]. Historically, the existence of the 
polyol pathway may have provided an evolutionary 
survival advantage, as fructose increases the storage of 
fat and glycogen, which may later be used to provide 
energy and water [11]. Fructose also causes sodium retention, 
and consequently higher blood pressure, which is an 
advantage in case of dehydration or salt deficiency [11]. 
However, modern-day non-physiological problems and 
processes that cause acute or chronic hyperglycaemia, 
such as diabetes mellitus, surgery [12–14]orcritical 
illness [15], may lead to more deleterious activation of 
the polyol pathway. 

Previous research has demonstrated low CSF polyol 
concentrations in normoglycaemic healthy individuals [16] 
and pregnant women [17], and increased CSF polyol levels 
in patients with neurological disorders, both with and without 
diabetes [18–20]. Moreover, continuous intravenous glucose 
infusion induces fructose formation in the brain during periods 
of hyperglycaemia [21]. 

Given the likelihood of saturation of the hexokinase pathway 
under supraphysiological glucose concentrations, we 
hypothesised that hyperglycaemia causes a proportional 
increase in CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose concentrations,

However, polyol concentrations and CSF polyol/glucose 
ratios under varying glycaemic conditions in patients without 
evident neurological abnormalities have not been investigated 
to date. Therefore, we aimed to study CSF fructose and sorbitol 
concentrations and ratios of CSF fructose and sorbitol to 
CSF glucose in patient groups with either normal or elevated 
CSF glucose concentrations. 

Methods 

Study design and ethics For this study, we used biomaterial 
and data from patients enrolled in a prospective cohort study, 
the Anaesthetic Biobank of Cerebrospinal Fluid (ABC) study. 
Plasma, CSF and clinical data were obtained from a subset of 
participants of the ABC repository, which was designed to 
collect and store CSF from patients without major neurological 
disease for future neuroscientific research. Patients aged 
18 years or older, scheduled for elective surgery under spinal 
anaesthesia, were eligible for inclusion. More extensive 
details of the study design, patient inclusion, and data and 
biomaterial collection are described elsewhere [22]. The 
ABC study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee 
of the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG) (registration 
number 2016–174) and written informed consent was 
obtained from all participants. The study was performed 
according to the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2013, 
and the trial was registered with trialregister.nl (number 
NL9356). All participants signed an informed consent form. 
Performance, recording, data analysis and reporting were 
conducted according to the Strengthening the Reporting of 
Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement 
for reporting observational studies. 

Study population and inclusion criteria From the 487 patients 
enrolled in the ABC study between October 2016 and 
November 2020, we selected 30 patients for this sub-study. 
We first excluded, from the ABC study cohort, patients 
with a CSF erythrocyte count >500 × 106/l (indicating 
CSF blood contamination [23]), patients with a known 

neurometabolic disorder (e.g. Parkinson’s disease, multiple 
sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, phenylketonuria, mitochondrial 
disorders), or those patients with an undetermined 
plasma or CSF albumin concentration. We then selected 
three groups of patients on the basis of their CSF glucose 
concentrations. For group 1 (control group), we selected ten 
patients at random whose CSF glucose concentration 
spanned the spectrum of concentrations considered to be 
normal (2.2–4.4 mmol/l). Among all patients with elevated 
CSF glucose concentrations (>4.4 mmol/l), we identified 
those without a diagnosis of diabetes and those with a diagnosis 
of type 2 diabetes, and ranked each group according 
to their CSF glucose concentrations. For these two groups, 
we selected the ten patients with the highest CSF glucose 
concentrations. 

Material collection and measurements Spinal puncture and 
collection of biomaterials were performed according to 
standardised procedures [22]. CSF (10 ml) was collected into 
five consecutive 2 ml syringes during the spinal puncture prior 
to intrathecal local anaesthetic injection. The first 2 ml syringe 
was used for routine analyses, including albumin, total 
protein, glucose, leucocyte and erythrocyte count. The 
remaining CSF was centrifuged (1000 g,10min,4°C)and 
stored at -80°C. Blood (20.5 ml) was collected during intravenous 
cannulation prior to surgery. Part of the blood 

(10.5 ml) was used for routine analyses (albumin, total 
protein, glucose and leucocyte count); the remaining blood 
was centrifuged (2000 g, 10 min, 4°C) and stored at -80°C 
for future analysis. 
CSF sorbitol and fructose concentrations were measured 
by the Core Facility Metabolomics of the Amsterdam 
University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC) in 300 µl 
CSF from the second 2 ml fraction by GC/flame ionisation 
detector, as previously described for plasma [24]. The 
interassay coefficient of variation was 5.7% for sorbitol and 
6.1% for fructose. The limit of detection and limit of quantification 
were 5 µmol/l for both compounds. First, a test 
sample from four patients was analysed for plasma and CSF 
sorbitol and fructose to assess the validity of the laboratory

analysis. Second, sorbitol and fructose concentrations in CSF 
were measured in all patients. 

Creatinine assays (as indicator of renal function) were later 
performed on an aliquot of stored plasma by the Department 
of Clinical Chemistry at Uppsala University, Sweden. 

We obtained relevant demographic data, medication use 
and medical history from patient records. As part of the 
ABC study procedures, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA), a brief cognitive screening tool for mild cognitive 
impairment, was used to assess cognitive function preoperatively, 
if logistically possible. 

Outcome First, between-group differences in baseline-and 
intraoperative characteristics and routine laboratory analyses 

(e.g. albumin and creatinine) were determined. As primary 
outcome measures, we determined the concentrations of plasma 
glucose, CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose for all groups, 
and calculated the CSF polyol/glucose ratios (CSF sorbitol/ 
CSF glucose and CSF fructose/CSF glucose). We then determined 
between-group differences in plasma glucose, CSF 
glucose, sorbitol, fructose, and CSF polyol/glucose ratios for 
groups 1, 2 and 3. The secondary outcomes were the correlations 
between plasma glucose levels and CSF glucose, sorbitol 
and fructose levels, as well as between cognitive function 
and CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose. In addition, the correlation 
between the CSF/plasma quotient of albumin (Qalb 
ratio) and plasma glucose, CSF glucose, CSF sorbitol and 
CSF fructose was analysed. The Qalb is an indicator of 
blood–CSF barrier permeability, and was calculated by dividing 
the concentration of albumin in CSF by the concentration 
of albumin in blood, × 1000. Last, age was correlated with 
plasma glucose, CSF glucose, CSF sorbitol and CSF fructose, 
and with CSF sorbitol/glucose and fructose/glucose ratios, 
and we also determined whether differences existed between 
men and women for these analytes. 

Sample size We based our sample size calculation on the 
expected between-group difference in the plasma concentration 
of sorbitol. Hwang et al [17] reported a mean plasma 
sorbitol concentration of 0.17 with an SD of 0.02 in a study 
of 25 pregnant women with and without diabetes. To detect a 
between-groupdifferenceof0.03withanSDof0.02using a 

two-sided a of 0.025 (to correct for two comparisons in three 
groups), it is necessary to include at least ten patients in each 
group. Therefore, we included a total of 30 patients in this 
study. 

Statistical analysis Analyses were performed using SPSS 
statistics software (version 23.0; IBM NY, USA). Data are 
expressed as mean ± SD and as median (IQR), when appropriate, 
plus range (minimum value – maximum value). We 
assessed for normality by visual inspection of the frequency 
distribution, the P–Pplot and Q–Q plot, and used the Shapiro– 
Wilk test when in doubt. Discrete data are displayed by category 
frequencies and percentages. Either a Pearson or 
Spearman rank correlation was performed when examining 
the relationship between two continuous variables. For 
comparisons between groups, the Mann–Whitney U test, 
Fisher’s exact test, the .2 test, the Fisher-Freeman-Halton 
test or the Kruskal-Wallis H test were used when appropriate. 
If the Kruskal-Wallis H test was significant, Dunn’spairwise 
tests were performed for the three pairs of groups. For 
pairwise comparisons between groups, significance values 
were adjusted by the Bonferroni correction for multiple tests. 
A p value <0.05 (for a two-tailed test) was considered statistically 
significant. 

Results 

Study cohort and patient characteristics Patient characteristics 
are shown in Table 1. The median age of the total group 
was 61 years (range 20–78) and 53% were female. Age 
differed significantly between the three study groups (significant 
between groups 1 and 2 [p=0.012] and groups 1 and 3 
[p=0.002]), and sex differed significantly between groups 1 

and 3 (p=0.015). BMI ranged from 19 to 40 kg/m2,witha 
median of 30 for the total sample. There was a significant 
difference in the American Society of Anesthesiology 
(ASA) physical status [25] between the groups. MoCA test 
scores ranged from 16 to 30 points (n =23). Only group 1 had 
a median MoCA score in the normal range (=26 points, n = 
10), groups 2 (n =6) and3(n = 7) had a significantly lower 
MoCA score (p=0.006 and p=0.039, respectively). Median 
Qalb values differed significantly between groups 1 and 3 
(p<0.001), but were within the normal range in all groups 
(Table 1). Finally, plasma creatinine was not different 
between groups (data not shown). 

Of the 30 patients included, 93% had at least one comorbid 
condition (other than the reason for surgery), and 90% were 
using at least one medication. Twenty-six of the patients had 
not suffered from an active central nervous system disorder in 
the 12 months preceding the collection of biomaterials. The 
four patients who did have a central nervous system disorder 
in the 12 months before biomaterial collection included one 
patient from group 1 (depression), two patients from group 2 
(epilepsy; small right thalamic infarction >6 months prior with 
no current medication use), and one patient from group 3 
(facial nerve schwannoma). One patient from group 1, three 
patients from group 2, and no patients from group 3 used 
corticosteroids. All patients in group 3 used glucoselowering 
medication. Five patients were on insulin therapy, 
of whom three used a combination of rapid-acting and longacting 
insulin, one patient used rapid-acting and intermediateacting 
insulin, and one patient used rapid-acting insulin 
together with ultra-long-acting insulin. Four patients were on 
oral glucose-lowering drugs, including biguanides, sulfonylurea 
derivatives and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. One 
patient used a combination of rapid-acting and long-acting 
insulin and a biguanide.

Our test samples showed that the detection limit of 
sorbitol and fructose in plasma and CSF was 6 µmol/l 
when processing 500 µl of material. Sorbitol was not 
detectable in plasma, and plasma fructose showed an 
abnormal peak pattern compared with what would be 
expected for CSF fructose (data not shown). Therefore, 
it was decided not to determine plasma polyols for the 
entire study population. 

Secondary outcomes The correlations between plasma and 
CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose, MoCA scores, Qalb and 
age are shown in Table 3. There was a strong positive correlation 
between plasma glucose and CSF glucose (rs =0.813, 
p<0.001), sorbitol (rs =0.870, p<0.001) and fructose (rs= 
0.834, p<0.001) when all patients were grouped together 
(Table 3 and Fig. 3a–c). Moreover, CSF sorbitol correlated 
strongly with CSF fructose in the total study group (rs= 
0.945, p<0.001), as well as in group 1 (rs =0.909, 
p<0.001), group 2 (rs =0.705, p=0.023) and group 3 (rs= 
0.827, p=0.003) individually. 

Preoperative MoCA scores were moderately inversely 
correlated with plasma glucose (p<0.01), CSF glucose 
(p<0.01), CSF sorbitol (p<0.05) and CSF fructose (p<0.01) 
(Table 3). There was a moderate positive correlation between 
Qalb and plasma glucose, CSF glucose, CSF sorbitol and CSF 
fructose (all p<0.001). 

In all patients grouped together, plasma glucose correlated 
with the CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio (rs = 0.516, p=0.004) 
(Fig. 3d), but not with the CSF fructose/o-glucose ratio. CSF 
glucose was strongly significantly correlated with CSF sorbitol 
(rs = 0.748, p<0.001) and CSF fructose (rs = 0.705, 
p<0.001). The CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio differed significantly 
across the groups (p=0.009), and there was a significant 
difference in the ratio between groups 1 and 3 (p=0.017) and 
between groups 2 and 3 (p=0.031) (Fig. 2c). The CSF 
fructose/glucose ratio did not differ between the groups 
(p=0.224) (Fig. 2d). 

Age was positively correlated with plasma glucose and 
CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose (all p=0.001) (Table 3), 
and the CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio (p=0.015), but not with 


the CSF fructose/glucose ratio (p=0.188). Finally, there was a 
significant difference between men and women for plasma 
glucose, CSF glucose and CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio (all 
p<0.05), and for CSF sorbitol and CSF fructose (p<0.01), 
but not for the CSF fructose/glucose ratio (p=0.146). 

Discussion 

In this study, patients with elevated CSF glucose levels also 
had significantly higher CSF sorbitol and fructose levels. 
Even when CSF glucose values were similar, patients with 
diabetes had a significantly higher CSF fructose, CSF sorbitol 
and CSF sorbitol/glucose ratio compared with patients without 
diabetes. Furthermore, CSF glucose, sorbitol and fructose 
concentrations increased linearly with an increase in systemic 
glucose levels. These findings are in line with our primary 
hypothesis that hyperglycaemia causes a proportional increase 
in polyol concentrations in CSF of patients without brain 
disorders. 

This proof-of-concept study is relevant because we demonstrate 
an activation of the polyol pathway across a broad spectrum 
of plasma and CSF glucose levels in patients both with 
and without diabetes. Activation of the polyol pathway is 
associated with possible cyto-and neurotoxic properties, and 
is thought to play a role in brain abnormalities and cognitive 
impairment through the formation of AGEs, non-enzymatic 
glycation of myelin or oxidative damage/stress [8–10]. For 
example, MRI has shown that a higher percentage of white 
matter hyperintensities are found in patients with affective 
disorders, and that these white matter hyperintensities are 
associated with increased glucose metabolism of the brain 
via the polyol pathway [8]. Furthermore, hyperglycaemia is 
associated with structural neuronal changes and impaired 
long-term spatial memory [26]. 

Our findings are consistent with the principle of Michaelis– 
Menten kinetics [27], which states that an increase in systemic 
glucose proportionally increases cerebral glucose via facilitated 
transport [27]. In addition, sorbitol and fructose concentrations 
in the CSF were comparable to those found in studies of 
patients with normal systemic glucose values [16, 17]. 
Activation of the polyol pathway during hyperglycaemia 
was demonstrated in the 1970s in patients with diabetes, but 
these patients were hospitalised for neurological disorders and 
thus were unlikely to have an intact blood–CSF barrier 
[18–20]. 

Interestingly, the CSF polyol/glucose ratios were exponentially 
increased when patients had diabetes, despite the fact 
that the CSF glucose levels of groups 2 and 3 were similar 
and there were no between-group differences in age, sex, 
MoCA scores or Qalb. Thus, the differences between the two 
groups could not be attributed to these factors. The steep 
increase may be due to a statistical dispersion; however, no 

such correlation was demonstrated between CSF sorbitol/ 
systemic glucose ratios and between CSF fructose/systemic 
glucose ratios. Possibly it is due to upregulation of the cerebral 
polyol pathway in diabetes patients because of chronic 
hyperglycaemia, combined with a saturation of the hexokinase 
pathway, leaving more glucose in the CSF for the polyol 
pathway. It has previously been shown that a state of chronic 
hyperglycaemia leads to an upregulation of the polyol pathway 
[28, 29], and, although this upregulation has not yet been 
demonstrated in the human brain [17], there is previous 
evidence for elevated glucose, sorbitol and fructose levels in 
the brains of a rat model for diabetes [30]. 

Plasma glucose correlated significantly with the CSF 
sorbitol/glucose ratio, but not with the CSF fructose/glucose 
ratio. Possibly this difference may be related to fructose catabolism 
by redirection of fructose to the pentose phosphate pathway 
via hexokinase or ketohexokinase [31]. Alternatively, 
this finding may be explained by the formation of precursors 
of AGEs such as 3-deoxyglucosone or methylglyoxal through 
non-enzymatic glycation of fructose. From fructose, the 
enzyme phosphokinase produces fructose-3-phosphate. Both 
fructose and fructose-3-phosphate may be converted to 3deoxyglucosone. 
In addition, fructose may be converted into 
triose phosphate by the action of fructokinase [32]. 

The measurement of polyols in CSF is a derivative measure 
of cerebral metabolism. As polyols can also be transported 
across the blood–CSF barrier, one may question the validity 
of CSF polyol values as a marker of cerebral glucose metabolism 
[33]. However, the measured plasma polyol concentrations 
were markedly lower than in the CSF or even below the 
limit of quantification. It has been previously demonstrated 
that the human brain produces polyols [21], and that the 
primary source of polyols in CSF is from the brain itself 
[21]. The higher levels of sorbitol and fructose in the CSF 
compared with plasma in our cohort also indicate this. 
Furthermore, the glucose, sorbitol and fructose CSF concentrations 
in our cohort correspond to those measured in previous 
studies [16–20]. Thus, it appears that changes in CSF 
sorbitol and fructose concentrations do indeed reflect changes 
in cerebral glucose metabolism. 

A limitation of the present study is that the data do not 
provide information about changes in glucose, sorbitol and 
fructose concentrations in the CSF over time, as these could 
not be determined given our current study design. Proof of 
activation of the cerebral polyol pathway over time could be 
provided by infusion of stable isotope-labelled glucose and 
subsequent recovery of these isotope labels in the sorbitol 
and fructose. In addition, a relatively small sample size was 
used, which did not allow statistical correction for patient 
characteristics such as age, sex, ASA physical status classification 
or MoCA scores. This may be remedied in the future by 
using a larger sample size. Finally, it is possible that some 
patients in group 2 may have had undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, 

and not all data important for diabetes patients were known 

(e.g. lipid status and HbA1c levels); it would be preferable to 
include these diagnostic measurements in future studies of 
diabetes patients. 
It is important to study whether these harmful metabolites 
are related to patient-relevant postoperative complications, 
and our results show that future studies can explore 
the potential of systemic glucose-lowering therapies such 
as insulin or incretin-based therapies to optimise cerebral 
glucose and polyol metabolism [34]. Suppression of the 
cerebral polyol pathway may, in theory, reduce cognitive 
impairment, and the role of (elevated) polyol concentrations 
in the development of cognitive decline should be 
investigated. 

In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that, even in 
patients without evident neurological abnormalities, glucose 
is converted to polyols in the polyol pathway. We have shown 
increased levels of cerebral polyols in patients with diabetes, 
which is a first indication of an upregulation of the cerebral 
polyol pathway in patients with diabetes without evident 
neurological abnormalities. Future studies could further investigate 
how this increase in polyols in the CSF evolves over 
time, and whether they are indeed associated with clinically 
relevant patient outcomes, and if so, whether reducing glucose 
conversion in the polyol pathway results in a reduction in the 
incidence of such outcomes.
