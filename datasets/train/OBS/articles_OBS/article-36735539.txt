Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported to be the third most common cancer worldwide (1,2). Detection and removal of adenomatous polyps during colonoscopy is the most effective way to reduce the incidence of CRC (3). However, a recent meta-analysis revealed that a quarter of colorectal adenomas were missed at screening colonoscopy and resulted in most cases of interval CRC (4). While the colonoscopy quality varies largely among different endoscopists (5), colonoscopy quality control is considered a vital factor to ensure the effectiveness of screening colonoscopy (6).

Audit and feedback of the colonoscopy quality metric is proven to be effective in improving the adenoma detection rate (ADR) (7,8). Guidelines or expert consensus recommend withdrawal time as an important quality indicator in colonoscopy (9–11). However, as a surrogate indicator of mucosal observation quality, withdrawal time has certain limitations. First, withdrawal time can only reflect the observation quality of the whole colon, but not reflect the unqualified observation by rapid withdrawal within colorectal segments (12). Second, withdrawal time could not reflect the effect of the withdrawal technique on mucosal observation quality (13). Moreover, several studies have not found any association between withdrawal time and adenoma detection (14) or between withdrawal time and the risk of CRC after screening (15). Thus, the validity of withdrawal time as a quality measure remains unclear (16). Therefore, it is necessary to establish a more reliable index to measure the colonoscopy quality to make up for the shortage of withdrawal time.

In the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made outstanding achievements in the clinical application of endoscopy (17). Our previous study established a real-time withdrawal speed monitoring system to control the withdrawal speed below the safe speed (18). With randomized controlled trials, the withdrawal speed monitoring system has proven to be effective in improving the ADR (8%–16% and 14.76%–24.54%, respectively) (18,19). However, it remains to be explored whether the proportion of overspeed frames (POF) of withdrawal can be a reliable substitute indicator to reflect the colonoscopy quality of endoscopists and whether the POF makes up for the lack of withdrawal time.

In this study, we have retrospectively enrolled a total of 1,804 eligible colonoscopy procedures to explore the relationship between the POF and withdrawal time and ADR and evaluate the feasibility of the POF as a quality control indicator. We hypothesized that the ADR is negatively correlated with the POF, and the combined assessment of the POF and withdrawal time would further increase the ADR.

METHODS
Introduction of the system
We conducted an automatic colonoscopy quality control system to calculate the POF and withdrawal time. The system consisted of 3 deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models and the withdrawal speed value calculation model based on a hash algorithm. DCNN1 identified the cecum; DCNN2 filtered out the frames of biopsy and polypectomy; and DCNN3 identified the frames of endoscope outside the body. Details of model training and testing are provided in the Supplementary Digital Content (see Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/A908). The similarity between continuous colonoscopy frames was calculated based on the perceptual hashing algorithm to obtain the withdrawal speed value. Details of the calculation of speed values are available in Supplementary Digital Content (see Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/A908).

In routine clinical practice, the POF and withdrawal time were calculated after the cecum was identified by DCNN1; the frames of biopsy and polypectomy were automatically filtered out by DCNN2; and the system stopped counting the POF and withdrawal time after the frames of endoscope outside the body were identified by DCNN3. Following the previous study, a value of > 44 was considered a dangerous withdrawal speed (too fast) (18). The validity of a value of >44 is provided in the Supplementary Digital Content (see Supplementary Material, https://links.lww.com/CTG/A908; Figure 1).

The POF was calculated as follows: The withdrawal frames of biopsy and polypectomy were filtered out, and the number of frames with the speed value > 44 was calculated:
 

Study design and participants
We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Thousand eight hundred four patients older than 18 years who attended the endoscopy center between May 10, 2020, and October 1, 2021, were included in this study. Patients with known contraindications to biopsy, bowel obstruction, or perforation; who were pregnant or lactating; who were suffering from polyposis syndromes; or who had a history of inflammatory bowel disease, CRC, or colorectal surgery were excluded. In addition, any patient whose cecum was not reached or who had suspicion for polyposis syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal tuberculosis, or CRC was also excluded. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. Informed consent was obtained from all patients.

Procedures
Operating endoscopists were from the Gastroenterology Department of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, with an endoscopy experience of 1–5 years and a total colonoscopy volume of 1,500–4,000. After the operating endoscopists found polyps, they were required to perform biopsies for histology and the staff assistant recorded the location, size, and morphological features according to the Paris classification.

After the colonoscopy, colonoscopy videos were collected. These videos were divided into images to calculate the POF and withdrawal time. Every 5% of the POF was treated as an interval; each interval is regarded as a point; and the lesion detection rate of each point represents the overall lesion detection rate of the interval. According to the ADR drop steeply point, we set a cutoff value of POF. First, the patients were classified into an LP group (the POF ≤ threshold, low POF) and HP group (the POF > threshold, high POF). Protocols or expert consensus recommend a standard withdrawal time of 6 minutes or longer (9–11). Second, the patients were classified into 4 groups according to the POF of 10% and withdrawal time of 6 minutes (ST-HP group: withdrawal time > 6 minutes and the POF > threshold, standard withdrawal time and high POF; standard withdrawal time and low POF (withdrawal time >6 min and the POF ≤10%) (ST-LP) group: withdrawal time >6 minutes and the POF ≤ threshold, standard withdrawal time and low POF; nonstandard withdrawal time and low POF (withdrawal time ≤6 min and the POF ≤10%) (NT-LP) group: withdrawal time ≤6 minutes and the POF ≤ threshold, nonstandard withdrawal time and low POF; NT-HP group: withdrawal time ≤6 minutes and the POF > threshold, nonstandard withdrawal time and high POF).

Furthermore, withdrawal videos were divided into 3 segments: the right colon defined as the cecum to the ascending colon, the transverse colon as the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure, and the left colon as the descending colon to the rectum. These videos were fed into the POF system after being divided into the 3 segments to calculate the POF in each of the 3 segments.

Outcomes of colonoscopy
The primary outcome of this study was the ADR. Secondary outcomes included the polyp detection rate (PDR), ADR/PDR for adenomas with different sizes (diminutive ≤5 mm, small > 5 to <10 mm, and large ≥10 mm) and locations (right colon, transverse colon, and left colon), advanced ADR (≥10 mm diameter, high-grade dysplasia, and villous histology), benign lesion detection rate (including hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps), sessile serrated lesion detection rate, mean number of adenomas or polyps per patient, ADR between patients above and below the determined POF threshold, and withdrawal time.

Statistical analysis
The primary aim of this study was to find out whether there was an inverse relationship between the POF and ADR. We calculated the ADR or PDR of each POF and performed the correlation analysis using Pearson analysis. The baseline characteristics among the study groups were compared using the χ2 test for categorical variables and one-way analysis of variance test for continuous variables. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the ADR or PDR at different sizes and locations, and advanced ADR between patients with the POF above and below the determined threshold. The analysis of the detection rate was at a patient-based level, such that one positive outcome was registered, regardless of the number of lesions. To address possible confounding effects, we built covariate-adjusted regression models by adding group differences into the models as covariates, including the indication for colonoscopy, age, bowel cleanliness, sex, status as inpatient or outpatient, and endoscope manufacturers. A Poisson regression was used to assess the effect of the intervention on the mean number of adenomas and polyps per patient. A 2-sided P value of less than 0.05 was judged statistically significant. All analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (version 20).

Ethics approval
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, with a waiver granted for the requirement of informed consent.

RESULTS
Patient enrollment and baseline data
A total of 1,932 patients were evaluated, and 1,836 eligible individuals were enrolled in this study. We excluded 32 patients during colonoscopy according to the exclusion criteria: 23 patients because of the endoscope being withdrawn (13 cancer obstruction and 10 lumen obstruction), 5 because of poor bowel preparation, and 4 because of inability to achieve cecal intubation. Finally, 1,804 eligible patients were analyzed (Figure 2). Baseline characteristics of patients are presented in Table 1 (see Supplementary Digital Content, Table S1, https://links.lww.com/CTG/A908).

Correlation analysis
Patient and segment distributions on different POFs are shown in Figure 3. The average ADR and PDR were calculated for each corresponding POF, and Table 2 presents the correlation coefficient between the POF and ADR and between the POF and PDR. Every 5% was treated as an interval; the POF was 5%, 10%, 15%, and >15%; and the ADR was 21.18%, 24.57%, 15.69%, and 12.24%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the POF and the ADR was −0.836. Inverse correlation could also be observed in the transverse colon with a Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.864. For PDR, the Pearson correlation coefficient for the whole colon, right colon, transverse colon, and left colon was −0.926, −0.919, −0.962, and −0.941, respectively.

Similarly, every 3 minutes was treated as an interval. For ADR and PDR, the withdrawal time was 3, 6, 9, and 9 minutes, the ADR was 15.86%, 21.28%, 20.26%, and 32.24%, respectively, the PDR was 56.55%, 55.08%, 58.66% and 84.15%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between withdrawal time and the ADR was 0.892. the Pearson correlation coefficient between withdrawal time and the PDR was 0.810 (see Supplementary Digital Content, Table S2, https://links.lww.com/CTG/A908).

Threshold comparison
We have drawn a dose-response curve to justify the POF threshold (Figure 4). The ADR dropped steeply at the point of the POF of 10%; therefore, the POF of 10% was set as a threshold and applied to analyze lesion detection rate difference. We divided the patients into 2 groups (LP group: the POF ≤10%, low POF; HP group: the POF >10%, high POF).

For adenoma detection, as presented in Table 3, the whole colon ADR in the LP group was significantly higher than that in the HP group (22.89% vs 15.27%; odds ratio [OR] 0.508, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.369–0.700, P < 0.01). Significantly higher ADR in the LP group was observed in the left colon (13.09% vs 6.65%; 0.415, 0.269–0.642, P < 0.01). Regarding the adenoma size analysis, the number of adenomas of all sizes detected in the LP group was significantly higher than that in the HP group (diminutive: 19.74% vs 13.79%, P < 0.01, 95% CI 0.385–0.754, OR 0.539; small: 4.15% vs 2.71%, P = 0.07, 95 % CI 0.274–1.053, OR 0.537; large: 2.36% vs 1.48%, P = 0.16, OR 0.522, 95 % CI 0.212–1.286).

For polyp detection, as presented in Table 3, the whole colon PDR in the LP group was significantly higher than that in the HP group (62.80% vs 48.03%; OR 0.487, 95% CI 0.380–0.625, P < 0.01). Significantly higher PDRs in the LP group were observed in the right colon (16.67% vs 12.56%; 0.695, 0.493–0.980, P = 0.04), transverse colon (19.10% vs 15.27%; 0.686, 0.497–0.946, P = 0.02), and left colon (54.15% vs 34.48%; 0.413, 0.321–0.532, P < 0.01).

The complementarity of the POF and withdrawal time
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis, a withdrawal time of 9 minutes is also a potential indicator of colonoscopy quality control (20); we further analyzed the lesion detection rate of withdrawal time 6–9 minutes and ≥9 minutes. The results showed that POF had no effect on ADR when withdrawal time reached more than 9 min, and the ADR of POF ≤10% was significantly higher than that with POF >10% at withdrawal time 6–9 minutes and less than 9 minutes (see Supplementary Digital Content, Table S5, https://links.lww.com/CTG/A908).

To explore the complementary effect of the POF and withdrawal time, we divided the patients into 4 groups: ST-HP group: withdrawal time > 6 minutes and the POF >10%, standard withdrawal time and high POF; ST-LP group: withdrawal time >6 minutes and the POF ≤10%, standard withdrawal time and low POF; NT-LP group: withdrawal time ≤6 minutes and the POF ≤10%, nonstandard withdrawal time and low POF; and NT-HP group: withdrawal time ≤6 minutes and the POF >10%, nonstandard withdrawal time and high POF.

The withdrawal time of the ST-HP group and ST-LP group was > 6 minutes, which was used to compare the influence of POF on ADR when the withdrawal time reaches the guideline standard. As presented in Table 4, the ADR in the ST-LP group was significantly higher than that in the ST-HP group (25.30% vs 16.50%; OR 0.463, 95% CI 0.296–0.724, P < 0.01). Moreover, significant improvement was also observed in the PDR in the ST-LP group (69.10% vs 51.46%; 0.436, 0.304–0.625, P < 0.01). Regarding the lesion size analysis, the number of adenomas and polyps of all sizes detected in the ST-LP group was significantly higher than that in the ST-HP group, although the lesions were smaller than 5 mm (adenomas 21.90% vs 15.05%, P < 0.01, 95% CI 0.295–0.755, OR 0.472; polyps 66.38% vs 47.57%, P < 0.01, 0.289–0.592, 0.414).

Data are shown as n (%).
n = number of patients. (%) = proportion of the patients. These data are shown as P value, mean range (95% CI). ST-HP group: withdrawal time > 6 minutes and the POF >10%, standard withdrawal time and high POF; ST-LP group: withdrawal time >6 minutes and the POF ≤10%, standard withdrawal time and low POF; NT-LP group: withdrawal time ≤6 minutes and the POF ≤10%, nonstandard withdrawal time and low POF; NT-HP group: withdrawal time ≤6 minutes and the POF >10%, nonstandard withdrawal time and high POF.
POF, proportion of overspeed frames.

The POF of the ST-LP group and NT-LP group was ≤10%, which was used to compare the influence of withdrawal time on ADR when the POF is below the threshold. As presented in Table 4, no statistically significant difference was found in the ADR between the ST-LP group and the NT-LP group (25.30% vs 21.14%; OR 0.877, 95% CI 0.667–1.153, P = 0.35). Significant improvement was observed in the PDR in the ST-LP group (69.10% vs 58.22%; 0.631, 0.492–0.809, P < 0.01; Table 4). Moreover, the ADR for large adenomas (≥10 mm) was significantly higher in the ST-LP group (3.57% vs 1.48%, P = 0.04, 95% CI 0.214–0.963, OR 0.454).

Subgroup analysis
The results were stratified according to the baseline characteristics to determine the presence or absence of an intervention modification. Compared with the HP group, the ADR in the LP group significantly improved in the following subgroups: indication for colonoscopy, age, bowel preparation, sex, recruitment, and brand of colonoscopy (see Supplementary Digital Content, Table S3, https://links.lww.com/CTG/A908). Regarding the comparison between the ST-LP group and the ST-HP group, ST-LP group, and NT-LP group, the ADR in the ST-LP group were significantly higher in the subgroups (see Supplementary Digital Content, Table S4, https://links.lww.com/CTG/A908).

DISCUSSION
This study successfully developed an objective and precise system to assess the colonoscopy withdrawal quality. Our data demonstrated that the combined evaluation of the POF system and withdrawal time can be a quality indicator that reflects the defect of colonoscopy operation. A strong correlation was found between the POF and ADR, and there is a complementary relationship between the POF and the withdrawal time on reflecting ADR.

In recent years, AI has made remarkable achievements in improving colonoscopy quality. Repici et al (21) achieved that real-time colonoscopy significantly increased ADR and adenomas detected per colonoscopy without increasing withdrawal time. Zhou et al (22) proposed a deep learning-based bowel preparation assessment system. However, few existing techniques were proposed to assess the withdrawal quality of endoscopists during colonoscopy. Our proposed method is based on the perceptual hashing algorithm to detect previously seen frames and calculate withdrawal speed and POF in colonoscopy videos. The perceptual hash algorithm continuously monitors withdrawal speed by comparing similarities between images (23,24). When endoscopists performed fast withdrawal or slipped, the algorithm can sensitively detect the low similarity between adjacent images and calculate the high instantaneous withdrawal speed and accumulate for POF. In a word, the more stable withdrawal, the lower the POF. Therefore, the POF was an available quality indicator for colonoscopy, reflecting the stability of withdrawal. We conjointly analyzed the influence of the POF and withdrawal time on lesion detection to assess withdrawal quality. Furthermore, we separately evaluated the performance of the POF system, which provided us with more convincing evidence.

Although withdrawal time has been developed as a quality metric to assess the quality of mucosal observation (25), monitoring withdrawal time was not necessarily associated with a significant increase in lesion detection (26,27). Therefore, we further analyzed the complementarity between POF and withdrawal time. When withdrawal time was >6 minutes, the ADR of the POF ≤10% was significantly higher than that the POF >10%. This lower POF explained the significantly improved ADR when withdrawal time was qualified. When the POF ≤10%, the ADR of withdrawal time >6 minutes was higher than that of withdrawal time ≤6 minutes; the lack of statistical significance may be because of the small sample size. This longer withdrawal time explained the significantly improved ADR when the POF was less than the threshold. These results suggest that conjoint analysis of the POF and withdrawal time was a reliable indicator of withdrawal quality.

Analysis in this study showed that ADR was strongly correlated with the POF. When the POF was 0%–10%, ADR gradually increased, and when the POF was 10%–25.1%, ADR gradually dropped. When the POF is 0%–10%, endoscopists in this range have adequate mucosal examination time, so the risk of missed diagnosis is very low. When the POF was more than 10%, the mucosal examination time decreased and the ADR dropped rapidly. Therefore, a POF of 10% or less indicates careful mucosal examination. Additional multicenter studies should further validate this threshold.

Regarding the lesion size, more adenomas of all sizes were detected in the group with POF ≤10% compared with the group with POF >10%. The observation that the POF system detected more diminutive and small adenomas supported the view that small polyps are more likely to be missed within the visual field compared with bigger and more prominent polyps (28–30). A previous study found that patients with advanced adenomas had a significantly higher risk of developing CRC than those without adenomas (31). Therefore, the fact that more advanced and large adenomas were detected in the group with POF ≤10% suggests that the use of the POF system can help reduce the risk of developing CRC. Further studies should address the role of the POF system in decreasing interval cancer, which is the main goal of screening colonoscopy.

Previous studies have reported that patients with diagnostic colonoscopy were associated with older age and higher rate of hospitalization, normally in worse conditions than those undergoing screening or surveillance procedures, and thus leading to a weaker tolerance to the anesthesia and colonoscopy procedure (32,33). Higher POF was observed in the patients with diagnostic colonoscopy in this study, which may attribute to a more hurried withdrawal caused by the weaker tolerance. To address possible confounding effects, we built covariate-adjusted regression models by adding group differences into the models as covariates. In addition, in our subgroup analysis, we found that POF was a valid indicator in different indications for colonoscopy.

There are several strengths of our study. First, we enrolled a large sample of patients and used ADR as the index to verify the POF system. Second, we conjointly analyzed the influence of the POF and withdrawal time on withdrawal quality and found the complementarity between the POF and the withdrawal time to lesion detection. Third, the images were from different scope manufacturers and, therefore, probably varied in brightness, size, and color, which ensured the generalizability of the POF.

Despite these strengths, we acknowledge certain limitations of this study. First, the enrolled patients were from a single center; further multicenter clinical trials should be performed to verify the effectiveness of the POF system in other centers. Second, this study was performed based on retrospectively collected colonoscopy videos. Randomized controlled trials should be performed to verify the effect of the POF system on reducing missed adenomas caused by excessive POF of colonoscopy withdrawal.

In conclusion, we successfully proposed an AI-based POF system. Ensuring low POF with qualified withdrawal time might help narrow the differences in colonoscopy techniques among endoscopists and offer great promise for colonoscopy quality control.
