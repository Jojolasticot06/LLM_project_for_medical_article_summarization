Recent evidence demonstrates that COVID-19 is associated with a high risk 
of developing acute kidney injury (AKI), in particular, in patients with acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1, 2). A recently published study 
including 3,993 hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed that the frequency of 
COVID-19–associated AKI was 46% and that mortality rates were six times higher 
compared with patients without AKI (3). Furthermore, in 35% of survivors, renal 
function had not recovered to baseline at discharge (3). In another multicenter 
study including 67 ICUs in the United States, 20% of ICU patients developed AKI 
and received renal replacement therapy (RRT) (4). Approximately 63% of these 
patients died while one third of the survivors remained RRT-dependent upon dis-
charge, and 15% of the survivors were still RRT-dependent on day 60 (4). A recent 
meta-analysis including 15 studies concluded that the development of AKI in 
COVID-19 was associated with a 19-fold increased odds of in-hospital death (5). 

Given the large impact of COVID-19–associated 
AKI on patient outcomes, especially among those 
treated with RRT, special attention is required to identify 
patients at higher risk for developing AKI early 
in the course of the syndrome, thus, enabling timely 
implementation of supportive measures. According 
to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 
(KDIGO) guidelines, AKI is diagnosed based on 
changes in kidney function such as rise in serum creatinine. 
However, serum creatinine has a low sensitivity; 
in patients with normal underlying kidney function, a 
significant proportion of the glomerular filtration rate 
has to be lost before a change in serum creatinine is detectable. 
Urine output has a low specificity as it can be 
effected by volume status, anti-diuretic hormone secretion, 
and medications, without actual change in kidney 
function (6). The recognition of AKI is unacceptably 
delayed in up to 43% of hospitalized patients (7), leading 
to potential loss of therapeutic opportunities. 

Increased urinary biomarkers of kidney stress can 
identify patients at high risk for AKI (8). In the cardiac 
surgical setting, the implementation of supportive 
measures in these high-risk patients might reduce the 
occurrence or severity of AKI (9, 10). In this context, tissue 
inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2) and the 
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP7) 
have been identified as possible AKI biomarkers, given 

that both molecules are released early following various 
insults to the kidney, resulting in reversible G1 cell 
cycle arrest (11–13). 

This study aimed to explore the role of the urinary 
biomarkers TIMP-2 and IGFBP7 to predict AKI in 
critically ill patients with COVID-19. 

METHODS 

Study Design and Ethics 

We conducted a multicenter, multinational, observational 
study in 12 centers across Europe and the 
United Kingdom. Institutional review board approval 
was obtained from the Research Ethics Committee of 
the Chamber of Physicians Westfalen-Lippe and the 
Westfalian Wilhelms University Muenster (2020-265f-
S) as well as the corresponding institutional review 
boards of all participating centers. The study was registered 
prior to patient enrollment at ClinicalTrials. 
gov (NCT04406688, date of registration May 28, 
2020). In the United Kingdom, it was approved as 
a National Institute for Health and Care Research 
(NIHR) portfolio study (NIHR Central Portfolio 
Management System Identificator 45824). The study 
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of 
Helsinki (Version Fortaleza, 2013). Written informed 
consent was obtained from all participating patients 
or representatives according to local requirements and 
legislation. 

Participants 

Eligible patients included adult patients with moderate 
or severe ARDS (according to the Berlin definition: 
acute onset of hypoxemia [moderate, Pao2/Fio2 = 
101–200 mm Hg with positive end-expiratory pressure 
(PEEP) = 5 cm H2O and severe, Pao2/Fio2 = 100 mm 
Hg with PEEP = 5 cm H2O] with bilateral infiltrates 
on frontal chest radiograph, with no evidence of left 
atrial hypertension) due to severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (positive polymerase 
chain reaction test). Patients were excluded if 
any of the following criteria were present: preexisting 
AKI, severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 
20 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic dialysis dependency, 
kidney transplant within the last 12 months, pregnancy 
or breastfeeding. 

Study Procedures 

Patients admitted with moderate or severe ARDS 
within 7 days due to COVID-19 infection were included 
in this study. Patients or their legally authorized 
representatives were approached by members of 
the study team and invited to give written informed 
consent/assent for participation in the study. Consent 
processes followed local guidelines. With informed 
consent in place, blood and urine samples were collected 
at different time points: at study inclusion, 
12 hours, and 24 hours later. Urinary (TIMP-2) × 
(IGFBP7) was measured using the NephroCheck test 
(BioMérieux, Lyon, France). 

Outcomes 

The purpose of this study was to analyze the predictive 
performance of (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) for moderate or 
severe AKI in patients with SARS-CoV-2–associated 
ARDS. Accordingly, the primary endpoint of the study 
was the rate of moderate or severe AKI (KDIGO stage 
2/3). within 7 days. Secondary endpoints included the 
rate of transient (< 72 hr) and persistent AKI (= 72 hr), 
treatment with RRT during hospital stay, duration of 
RRT, mortality during hospital stay, duration of mechanical 
ventilation, duration of vasopressor administration, 
and ICU and hospital length of stay. 

Statistical Analysis 

In the primary statistical analysis, the distribution of 
biomarker values (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) at study inclusion, 
12 hours, and 24 hours after inclusion was 
compared between those patients who did and did not 
reach the primary endpoint using two-sided WilcoxonMann-
Whitney (WMW) tests . Sample size considerations 
were based on previously published data (14). 
At 12 hours after inclusion, median biomarker values 
of 0.2 and 0.5 (ng/mL)2/1,000, respectively, were expected 
in patients who did not and did reach the primary 
endpoint, with sds of logarithmized values 1 and 
3, respectively. Five percent of the recruited patients 
are assumed to have missing data, and among the remaining 
patients, 25% are assumed to reach the primary 
endpoint. Under these assumptions the power of 
the WMW test is greater than85%. 

Multivariable predictive analyses of the occurrence 
of the primary endpoint were performed by logistic 

regression. An initial model includes the baseline 
clinical variables sex, age, weight, hypertension, congestive 
heart failure, diabetes, CKD (eGFR < 60 mL/ 
min), severe ARDS, peripheral vascular disease, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin 
receptor blockers. Based on the initial model 
stepwise variable selection was applied to establish a 
clinical reference model, as well as a new model with 
the additional biomarker (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7). The 
predictive performance regarding the occurrence of 
the primary endpoint was evaluated by receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) analyses, the Youden index, 
the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and 
the category-free net reclassification improvement 
(cfNRI). 

Statistical analyses were performed using the SAS 
software (Version 9.4 for Windows; SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC) and IBM SPSS Statistics 28 for Windows (IBM 
Corporation, Somers, NY). All statistical analyses are 
exploratory, not confirmatory. p values are regarded 
noticeable (“significant”) in case p value of less than or 
equal to 0.05 without adjustment for multiple testing. 
An overall significance level was not determined and 
cannot be calculated. 

RESULTS 

Patients 

The study was conducted between June 2020 and 
December 2021 in 12 centers in Germany, Spain, Italy, 
Portugal, and the United Kingdom. A total of 766 
patients were screened and 300 patients were enrolled 
(Fig. 1). Mean age was 57 years (sd, 14 yr) and 71% 
were males. Baseline serum creatinine was 0.83 mg/ 
dL (sd, 0.21 mg/dL). Median Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment score was 7 (Q1–Q3, 3–10) and median 
Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II 
score 16 (Q1–Q3, 11–25). Further baseline characteristics 
are shown in Table 1. 

Patients who met the primary endpoint were older, 
more likely to suffer from peripheral vascular disease 
and had higher severity of illness scores. (Table 1) 

Outcomes 

Of 300 included patients, 86 developed AKI (28.7%) 
of which 46 episodes were transient and 29 persistent 
(Table 2). Thirty-nine of 300 patients (13%) met 


Figure 1. Participant flow. AKI = acute kidney injury, ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome, eGFR = estimated glomerular 
filtration rate. 

the primary endpoint moderate/severe AKI within 
7 days (15 patients [5.0%] KDIGO stage 2 and 24 
patients [8.0%] KDIGO stage 3). The median time 
to development of AKI was 1 day (Q1–Q3, 0–2 d). 
Among patients meeting the primary endpoint, 17 
of 39 received RRT (43.6%) and 32 died (82.1%) 
(Table 2). 

Biomarker Performance 

Patients who met the primary endpoint had significantly 
higher urinary (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) concentrations 
at the time of inclusion and 12 hours later 
compared with endpoint-negative patients (inclusion: 
median 1.73 [Q1–Q3, 1.0–2.48] [ng/mL]2/1,000 vs 0.31 
[Q1–Q3, 0.15–0.71] [ng/mL]2/1,000; p < 0.001; 12 hr: 
median 0.92 [Q1–Q3, 0.25–1.44] [ng/mL]2/1,000 vs 
0.30 [Q1–Q3, 0.13–0.87] [ng/mL]2/1,000; p = 0.003). 
No significant differences in (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) 
levels were detectable at 24 hours (Fig. 2). 

At inclusion, the optimal cutoff value (maximizing 
the Youden index) for the prediction of the primary 
endpoint was 0.90 (ng/mL)2/1,000 (Youden index, 
0.67; sensitivity, 85%; specificity, 82%) (eTable 1, 
http://links.lww.com/CCM/H320). 

The median lead time provided by the positive biomarker 
result was 24 hours (Q1–Q3, 0–24 hr). 

The ROC analyses for prediction of AKI resulted 
in an area under the receiver operating characteristic 

curve (AUC) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84–0.93) at inclusion, 

0.67 (95% CI, 0.56–0.78) at 12 hours and 0.58 (95% 
CI, 0.46–0.70) at 24 hours after inclusion (Fig. 3A). For 
prediction of persistent AKI, the AUC was 0.81 (95% 
CI, 0.73–0.90) at inclusion, AUC 0.60 (95% CI, 0.46– 
0.73) at 12 hours and AUC 0.60 (95% CI, 0.47–0.73) 
at 24 hours (Fig. 3B). For prediction of RRT, the AUC 
was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.86) at inclusion, 0.58 (95% 
CI, 0.45–0.72) at 12 hours and 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44– 
0.70) at 24 hours (Fig. 3C). 
Additional Predictive Ability of (TIMP-2) × 
(IGFBP7) Over Clinical Variables 

Urinary (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) significantly improved 
risk prediction when added to the clinical model for 
the primary endpoint, using ROC, AUC, IDI, and 
cfNRI analyses (eTable 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/ 
H320). 

DISCUSSION 

The Acute Disease Quality Initiative consensus state-
ment on COVID-19–associated AKI recommended 
to investigate novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and 
prognosis of AKI in the setting of COVID-19. Urinary 
(TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) concentrations have been analyzed 
in non-COVID-19 settings with good predictive 
ability to detect patients at risk for AKI (11, 13, 15). In

a biomarker-based approach, these two G1 cell cycle 
arrest markers guided the implementation of a bundle 
of supportive measures which was associated with a 
significantly reduced occurrence of AKI (9). Such a patient 
individualized approach using novel biomarkers 
could also be beneficial for COVID-19 patients in order 
to improve outcomes. However, first it is important to 
investigate whether (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) is also predictive 
for AKI in this specific setting. In this study, we 
demonstrated that urinary (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) has 
an even better ability to predict AKI than in other settings 
(15, 16). When adding (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) to 
a clinical model, risk prediction increased significantly 
compared with only using clinical variables. In other 
settings, it has been demonstrated that the implementation 
of the KDIGO bundle (discontinuation of all 
nephrotoxic agents, ensure volume status and perfusion 
pressure, consideration of a functional hemodynamic 
monitoring, monitoring of serum creatinine 
and urine output, avoidance of hyperglycemia, and 
consideration of alternatives to radiocontrast agents) 
in patients at high risk for AKI can reduce the occurrence 
of AKI (9, 10, 17). Transferring the new data to 
COVID-19 patients, patients with elevated (TIMP-2) 
× (IGFBP7) levels should also be treated according to 
the KDIGO guidelines by implementing the KDIGO 
bundle. 

To our best knowledge, only few small studies have 
investigated the performance of (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) 
in critically ill patients with COVID-19. One small 
study demonstrated that patients with COVID-19 

associated AKI and high levels of (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) 
were more prone to receive RRT compared with those 
with low levels of (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) (18). Another 
small observational study showed that urinary (TIMP

2) × (IGFBP7) greater than or equal to 0.2 was a risk 
factor for AKI (hazard ratio 7.23; 95% CI, 0.99–52.4; 
p = 0.050) (19). Both studies did not specifically focus 
on COVID-19 patients with ARDS. 
Interestingly, we found that urinary (TIMP-2) × 
(IGFBP7) did not persisted for very long after enrollment. 
Although levels at 12 hours were still significantly 
higher in patients who met the endpoint, 
the levels were, on average, lower than at enrollment 
(Fig. 2). The predictive value of (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) 
is dependent on the kinetic of the biomarkers in the 
context of the course of the disease. We know from 
other studies that (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) sharply 
increases after an insult and then rapidly decreases. 
Obviously, the first time point we measured (TIMP

2) × (IGFBP7) was at the peak of the kinetic curve 
and therefore the predictive value was very good. 
Therefore, it is possible that the two later time points 
were too late. We speculate that hypoxemia may have 
been the trigger for kidney stress which was then reflected 
by (TIMP-2) and (IGFBP7) release. Once the 
patient was admitted to the hospital, the hypoxemic 
stress was presumably reduced or eliminated completely. 
Further studies will need to explore this hypothesis 
further. 
Important strengths of this study are the multicenter 
study design as well as the large sample size and the 

application of both, serum creatinine and urine output 
criteria to diagnose AKI. However, we also acknowledge 
some limitations. First, we cannot account for the 
virus type. Most of the patients were included during 
the Delta variant interval. However, due to the international 
collaboration, we cannot preclude that some 
patients may have been infected with other variants. 
Whether the risk of AKI varies with different virus variants 
or (unlikely) impacts the expression of (TIMP-2) × 
(IGFBP7) is unknown. Second, we focused on COVID19 
patients with moderate and severe ARDS who are 
particularly susceptible for AKI. It remains unknown 
whether the results are generalizable to other COVID19 
cohorts. Third, as the biomarker levels within the 
first 24 hours of enrollment were not different, the timing 
of the measurement in the course of the COVID-19 
infection is very important. In this study, the median 
time from moderate/severe ARDS to inclusion was 0 
days. The results of this study may not be transferable to 
patients meeting the ARDS criteria days earlier. Fourth, 
confounding is a frequent issue in observational studies. 
To control for this, we per-formed multivariable 
analyses and confirmed the additional value of (TIMP


2) × (IGFBP7) for early identifying AKI. However, residual 
effects from unmeasured confounders upon the 
findings cannot be ruled out. 
CONCLUSIONS 

In patients with COVID-19–associated moderate or 
severe ARDS, urinary (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) demonstrated 
a high predictive ability for moderate or severe 
AKI. Future studies need to investigate whether (TIMP


2) × (IGFBP7) based implementation of supportive 
measures helps to reduce the occurrence of AKI.
