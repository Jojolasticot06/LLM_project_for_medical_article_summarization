INTRODUCTION 

In the second half of the 20th century, family 
medicine differentiated from general practice 
as a result of the increased appreciation 
of the importance of primary healthcare, 
the psychosocial aspects of health and the 
complexity of causation.1–3 ‘General practitioners’ 
in countries such as the UK and the 
Netherlands are expected to undergo vocational 
training (medical residency), and thus 
are family physicians by another name.4–6 

In Brazil, emphasis on primary healthcare 
coincided with the fight for redemocratisation, 
culminating in the establishment of a 
national health system called Sistema Único 
de Saúde (SUS; Unified Health System).1 7–10 
Meanwhile, in the 1970s, movements called 
community medicine (medicina comunitária) 
and comprehensive medicine (medicina integral) 
merged into a medical specialty then 

called community general medicine (medicina geral comunitária).
1 7–9 In 2000–2001, after SUS started expanding 
access to primary healthcare through the Family Health 
Strategy (then Family Health Programme, conceived 
based on community general medicine and other 
inputs7 11 12), community general medicine resolved its 
differences with family medicine, resulting in a medical 
specialty now called family and community medicine 
(medicina de família e comunidade, MFC).1 8 Preventive and 
social medicine (medicina preventiva e social) remains a 
separate specialty, despite the partially overlapping scope 
of practice.1 

The concepts of ‘field of competence’ and ‘core competence’
13 have been considered useful for understanding 
the interplay between the disciplines of primary healthcare 
and family and community medicine.9 Family and 
community medicine having its core competencies does 
not preclude it from sharing primary healthcare as a field 
of competence, or vice-versa. Even though McWhinney 
and Freeman have argued family medicine to be an 
academic discipline separate from other medical disciplines,
2 14 15 they also recognised distinctions among disciplines 
are sometimes more administrative and historical 
than epistemological.2 

In Brazil, neither primary healthcare nor family and 
community medicine is acknowledged as a knowledge 
area in the official ‘tree of knowledge’ adopted by CAPES 
(the Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of 
Graduate Education), CNPq (the National Council for 
Scientific and Technological Development) and FINEP 
(the Funding Authority for Studies and Projects). This 
means research grant applications and postgraduate 
programmes (master’s and PhD degrees) must be registered 
in correlated knowledge areas, such as interdisciplinary, 
medicine or collective health, or in some subarea 
or specialty within those knowledge areas. In Latin 
America, ‘collective health’ comprises (among other definitions16) 
public health, epidemiology and humanities 
and social sciences in health.17 

Accordingly, there are only a few postgraduate 
programmes on primary healthcare or Family Health18–21 
(but no one on family and community medicine, that 
we know of) in Brazil, and university departments dedicated 
to primary healthcare and/or family and community 
medicine are exceedingly rare. Brazilian journals 
on primary healthcare and/or family and community 
medicine have little prestige, and thus a substantial part 
of relevant research is expected to be published in other, 
more general journals (this is not specific to Brazil22). 
All this makes it very hard to gather a comprehensive 
understanding of postgraduate education and research 
in primary healthcare and/or family and community 
medicine. 

In this study, we hope to shed some light on the postgraduate 
education of primary healthcare professionals 
in Brazil by using specialisation in family and community 
medicine as an indicator of likelihood of involvement 
with primary healthcare. Our objective was to explore 

their trajectories in postgraduate education (master’s 
and PhD degree), describing the characteristics of their 
postgraduate degrees as well as correlating such degrees 
with characteristics of the physicians and their previous 
training. 

METHODS 

In this article, we report results from an observational, 
exploratory study, integrating administrative data from 
multiple sources: the Trajetórias MFC project. 

Data sources 

We compiled the list of family and community physicians 
in Brazil from two sources, corresponding to the 
two modes of recognition as a specialist for physicians 
in Brazil.23 One mode is certification by the corresponding 
specialty association. Such specialty certificates 
are conferred to physicians with either experience or a 
medical residency who pass an exam occurring once 
or twice every year, since 2003.3 8 We obtained the list 
of certified family and community physicians, as of late 
November 2018, from Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina 
de Família e Comunidade (SBMFC, the Brazilian Society 
of Family and Community Medicine), corresponding 
to the first 24 editions of the specialist certification 
exam. For physicians having renewed their certification 
(which is not required), we kept only data on their first 
certification. 

The other way of being recognised as a specialist is 
completing a medical residency. In late December 2018, 
we downloaded spreadsheets from SisCNRM (the information 
system for medical residency) on both family and 
community medicine and general community medicine 
(ie, from after and before the specialty was renamed) 
and merged the lists. Again, for the few physicians having 
completed a medical residency more than once, we kept 
only data on their first medical residency. 

After obtaining the data from both sources, we merged 
the lists into a single list of family and community physicians, 
using both the name and the CPF (Cadastro de 
Pessoas Físicas) registry identification number. We verified 
this compiled list extensively for internal consistency, 
resorting when necessary to searching the web and 
looking up in the Lattes Platform. Lattes Platform is the 
Brazilian information system on science, technology and 
innovation. Created in 1999, its curricula vitae (CVs) tend 
to be quite complete because they are used for decisions 
on research funding and recruitment, promotion and 
tenure.24 Furthermore, CVs in the Lattes Platform tend 
to be honest because researchers are accountable for the 
information they provide. For example, their individual 
CVs are publicly available as web pages and eXtensible 
Markup Language (XML) files. 

After compiling the list of family and community physicians, 
we obtained the Lattes Platform ID number by 
looking up the Lattes Platform using the physicians’ CPF 
numbers or names, and used this ID number to download 
the corresponding CVs in XML format in late December 
2018. Data on the postgraduate courses were extracted 
from the Lattes XML files, and data entered manually by 
the physicians (instead of selecting from predefined lists) 
were verified by looking up the postgraduate programmes 
in the Sucupira Platform (the Brazilian information 
system on postgraduate programmes)25 and searching 
the web for the monographs. We then obtained further 
data on the postgraduate programmes from the Sucupira 
Platform using postgraduate programme ID codes found 
in the Lattes CVs. Because international programmes are 
not in the official lists or in the Sucupira Platform, we 
entered the code for the knowledge area and the mode 
of the master’s degree by hand based on the programme 
title. We considered physicians without a Lattes CV as not 
having earned a master’s degree nor PhD. 

Variables 

We inferred gender from the physician’s first name, using 
data from the 2010 Brazilian Census26 cached in the 
genderBR package V.1.1.0.27 First names were considered 
female if they had 50% or more probability of belonging 
to a woman, and male if otherwise; names appearing 
less than 20 times in the Census were not assigned any 
gender. The date when the Lattes CVs were last updated 
was retrieved from CVs themselves. 

When the physician had both completed a medical 
residency and received a specialty certificate, we considered 
whichever came first as the mode of specialisation. 
The year of specialisation or completion of master’s or 
PhD degree was categorised in 5-year periods, with the 
first period (up to 1998, the last year before the inception 
of the Lattes Platform) having an open beginning. 
Likewise, the states where the specialisation or completion 
of master’s or PhD took place were grouped into 
the five geographical regions (North, Northeast, Southeast, 
South and Central-West), with an extra category for 
international postgraduate programmes (Supplemental 
Table in Fontenelle et al28 lists data for individual states). 
The knowledge areas were handled at the ‘basic knowledge 
area’ level (ie, not at the ‘greater knowledge area’ 
level or the ‘subarea’ or ‘specialty’ levels), and areas 
other than medicine or collective health were grouped 
in a catchall category (Supplemental Table in Fontenelle 
et al28 lists data for individual basic knowledge areas). 
Master’s degrees were also categorised according to their 
mode, that is, according to whether they were academic 
or professional. While both modes involve immersion in 
research, the academic master’s courses aim to produce 
researchers, and the professional ones aim to produce 
better professionals for outside academia.29 30 Professional 
PhD courses are very recent, and we did not expect 
any degree to have been earned yet. 

Analysis 

Categorical data were described with absolute and relative 
frequencies, and continuous data were described 
with medians and IQRs. Besides describing gender and 

characteristics of specialisation and master’s and PhD 
degrees, we also described the frequency of master’s 
degrees among family and community physicians 
according to their gender and characteristics of specialisation, 
as well as the frequency of PhD degrees according 
to the same characteristics as well as to the characteristics 
of the master’s degree. Because the interpretation of the 
year of specialisation depends on whether the specialisation 
was through medical residency or certification, year 
and mode of specialisation were merged into a single 
variable to describe the frequency of master’s and PhD 
degrees. 

The association of the beforementioned explanatory 
variables with having earned a master’s degree (one 
response variable) or PhD (another response variable) 
was expressed with the odds ratio (OR). While the prevalence 
ratio could be more intuitive, the OR better approximates 
the incidence density (rate) ratio.31 The ORs were 
estimated through logistic regression both with a single 
and with multiple explanatory variables at a time, and 
were expressed as point estimates and 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UI). All regression coefficients (including the 
intercept) had weakly informative prior distributions,32 
and inference was based on the No-U-Turn sampler.33 Year 
and mode of specialisation were entered in such regression 
models separately along with an interaction term 
between them but, for ease of understanding, the results 
were presented as if there was a single ‘year and mode 
of specialisation’ variable. In the multivariable model for 
the PhD degree, we opted for a hierarchical framework.34 
The ‘distal level’ of the hierarchical framework included 
gender and characteristics of the specialisation, and the 
‘proximal level’ included characteristics of the master’s 
degree. Variables in the distal level had their OR adjusted 
for other variables in the distal level, and variables in the 
proximal level had their OR adjusted for all other variables 
in the model, from both levels. 

Time from specialisation to master’s and PhD degrees, 
and between the two later ones, was described both in 
general and according to the mode of specialisation. 
We also examined the distribution of the knowledge 
areas of the master’s degrees according to the mode of 
specialisation, and the distribution of knowledge areas 
of PhD degrees according to the mode of specialisation 
and the knowledge area of the master’s degree. We did 
not examine the distribution of the knowledge area of 
the PhD degree according to the mode of the master’s 
degree, because too few family and community physicians 
with a professional master’s degree earned a PhD. When 
describing the distribution of the knowledge area of the 
PhD according to the knowledge area of the master’s 
degree, we opted for an alluvial diagram. 

The data were analysed using R V.3.6.1.35 While data 
verification by hand involved spreadsheet applications 
from office suites, most data processing (including the 
tabulation of frequencies) was done within R itself, using 
packages centred around the concept of ‘tidy data’,36 
as well as packages specific to Brazilian data.27 37 For

and community physicians in Brazil, December 2018. 


regression modelling we used brms V.2.10.0,38 which 
builds on the Stan probabilistic programming language39 
through rstan V.2.19.2.40 The alluvial diagram was made 
with ggalluvial V.0.10.0.41 

Ethics 

While most of the data sources we used are publicly available, 
there were two privacy issues. First, the spreadsheet 
SBMFC provided us with the complete list of certificates 
(including the CPF number of most) is not publicly available 
as such. Second, while all data we obtained from the 
Lattes Platform are publicly available, they lied behind 
technology intended no hinder data mining. Thus, 
before initiating the data collection we obtained approval 
by the research ethics committee of Universidade Vila 
Velha (certificate 02957118.2.0000.5064). Because our 
data are personally identifiable, they will be available 
only if researchers present an ethically approved research 
project with an analysis plan.42 

RESULTS 

Figure 1summarises the compilation of the list of family 
and community physicians included in this study. The 
first 24 editions of the specialist certification exam 
resulted in the emission of 2816 certificates, amounting 
to 2795 unique physicians. Furthermore, 3959 medical 
residencies were completed (936 in general community 
medicine and 3023 after it was renamed family and 
community medicine), amounting to 3957 unique physicians. 
Because 514 physicians both concluded a medical 
residency and were certified, there were 6238 unique 
family and community physicians. Of these, 4065 (65.2%) 
had a CV in the Lattes Platform. Median time since these 
CVs were last updated was 1year, with an IQR of 0–4 years 
and a maximum of 18 years. 

Most family and community physicians (3563, 57.1%) 
were female, and the most common mode of specialisation 
was medical residency (3917, 62.8%, table 1). 
The number of new family and community physicians 
increased over time, with the largest increases being 
from 1999–2003 (5.9%) to 2004–2008 (21.9%) and from

modes. 

2009–2013 (25.2%) to 2014–2018 (37.9%). Specialisation 
in family and community medicine was concentrated in 
the Southeast and South regions. 

A master’s degree was obtained by 747 (12.0%) family 
and community physicians (table 2), with 554 (74.2%) 
degrees being academic and the other 193 (25.8%) 
being professional. The number of new master’s degrees 
increased with time, especially from 2004–2008 to 
2009–2013; from 2009–2013 to 2014–2018, the increase 
was restricted to professional master’s degrees. As for 
specialisation, master’s degrees were concentrated in 
the Southeast and South regions, both for academic and 
professional degrees. Master’s degrees in collective health 
(351, 47.0%) were twice as frequent as those in medicine 
(170, 22.8%), with other frequent knowledge areas being 
interdisciplinary (84, 11.2%), teaching (30, 4.0%) and 
education (24, 3.2%). Professional degrees accounted for 
104 (29.6%) of the master’s degrees in collective health, 
but only 27 (15.9%) of those in medicine. The postgraduate 
programmes were spread across 141 institutions, with 
only eight of them having conferred a master’s degree 
to at least 20 family and community physicians. Most 
family and community physicians obtained their master’s 
degrees from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do 
Sul (UFRGS; Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul), 
Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz; Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) 
or Universidade de São Paulo (USP; University

A PhD degree was held by 170 (2.7%) family and 
community physicians (table 2). There were no professional 
PhD degrees. As with master’s degrees, there was an 
increase in new PhD degrees over time, and most degrees 
were obtained in the Southeast and South regions of 
Brazil. Contrary to master’s degrees, PhD degrees were 
more evenly distributed between medicine (64, 38%) 
and collective health (72, 42%). The postgraduate 
programmes were spread across 40 institutions, with only 
two of them (USP and UFRGS) having conferred more 
than 20 degrees; more information on the Supplemental 
Table in Fontenelle et al.28 

Some groups of family and community physicians 
were less likely to hold a master’s or PhD degree, even 
after adjusting for other characteristics (tables 3 and 4). 
Women were less likely to hold a master’s degree than 
their male colleagues, and only half as likely to hold a 
PhD. Family and community physicians with a professional 
master’s degree were . as likely to earn a PhD 
as those with an academic master’s degree. A master’s 
degree in other knowledge areas was also associated with 
a lower likelihood of earning a PhD than a master’s in 
medicine or collective health. 

Among those earning a master’s degree, the median 
time from specialisation to master’s degree was 4 years 
(IQR, 0–6): 5 years (IQR, 3–8) for family and community 
physicians specialising through medical residency, and 

1year (IQR, -3 to 4) for those specialising through certification. 
Earning a master’s degree came before specialisation 
for 21.8% family and community physicians: 9.1% 
for those specialising through medical residency, and 
39.9% for those specialising through certification. The 
proportion of master’s degrees in each of the knowledge 
areas (medicine, collective health, other) was very similar 
across the specialisation modes (certification or medical 
residency, table 5). 

Likewise, the median time from specialisation to PhD 
degree was 9 years (IQR, 3.25–12): 10 years (IQR, 7–14) 
for family and community physicians specialising through 
medical residency, and 2 years (IQR, -2.5 to 9) for those 
specialising through certification. Earning a PhD degree 
came before specialisation for 16% family and community 
physicians: 6% for those specialising through medical 
residency, and 33% for those specialising through certification. 
As with the master’s degrees, the proportion 
of PhD degrees in each of the knowledge areas (medicine, 
collective health, other) was very similar across the 
specialisation modes (certification or medical residency, 
table 6). 

Finally, the median time from master's to PhD degree 
was 4 years (IQR, 0–6). Most family and community physicians 
earning a PhD in collective health (50, 69%) also 
earned a master’s degree in the same knowledge area 
(figure 2). On the other hand, half of those earning a 
PhD in medicine earned a master’s degree in collective 
health (11, 17%) or no master’s degree at all (ie, direct

DISCUSSION 

Our findings indicate one in eight family and community 
physicians have earned a master’s degree, and little more 
than 1 in 40 have earned a PhD. The number of new 
degrees is increasing over time, and most of the degrees 
are in collective health (not medicine) and were obtained 
in the Southeast and South regions. Gender is associated 
with the probability of obtaining a master’s degree 
and, together with the mode and knowledge area of the 
master’s degree, also with that of obtaining a PhD degree. 
In comparison to family and community physicians 
specialising through medical residency, those specialising 
through certification were more likely to already have 
earned a master’s and/or PhD degree (instead of earning 
after specialisation), but just as likely to have earned their 
degree in medicine, collective health or other knowledge 
areas. 

Professional master’s programmes are responsible for 
most of the recent increase in the number of master’s 
degrees, and might be attracting graduate students who 
would otherwise opt for academic programmes. The 
Northeast region, with its RENASF network of institutions 
offering a professional master’s programme focused 
on the Family Health Strategy,19 20 accounts for part of 

this increase, as does the state of Rio de Janeiro, whose 
capital city recently invested heavily in the expansion 
of the Family Health Strategy and incentivised health 
professionals to earn master’s degrees21; but the increase 
in professional master’s degrees was not restricted to 
these states (data not shown). Even though the ProfSaúde 
programme18 is expected to contribute to this increase, 
it does not account for our findings, because its first 
students graduated after we obtained our data. 

Brazil has been promoting professional master’s 
degree on Family Health alongside other qualification 
initiatives, such as residencies, short postgraduate 
courses, and academic master’s degree.21 30 While one 
would expect any qualification to contribute something, 
responsible public policies for human resources 
in health depend on critically examining the relative 
benefits of the multiple possible postgraduate trajectories. 
For example, some qualification initiatives might 
add little to the performance of professionals who are 
already sufficiently qualified, or who are not qualified 
enough to benefit from said initiatives. Furthermore, for 
better or for worse, a professional master’s degree should 
increase employability in academia (even if presumably 
not as much as an academic master’s degree), thereby 
increasing workforce turnover in the Family Health 
Strategy while contributing to the education of the new 
generation of health professionals.

This debate is made even more timely by the advent 
of professional PhD programmes. Graduates from professional 
master’s courses seem to be less likely to earn PhD 
degrees, even after adjusting for potential confounders, 
such as when was the master’s degree concluded. Because 
graduates from professional programmes are expected 
to be outside academia, they might not find value in 
academic PhD courses. It remains to be seen if professional 
PhD programmes are needed to fill this niche, or if 
simply there’s not much use for any PhD outside academia. 
Meanwhile, physicians are still not required to complete 
a medical residency (or otherwise be certified) before 
working in primary care in Brazil, and posts in medical 
residencies lag behind the annual number of newly graduated 
physicians (the same applies for nurses).43 

Another major finding is that most family and community 
physicians hold master’s and PhD degrees in collective 
health, not medicine. This phenomenon is more 
common for master’s than for PhD degrees, and for 
professional than for academic degrees, but it occurs in 
both levels and both modes of postgraduate programmes. 
We cannot say this came as a surprise: of the authors who 
are family and community physicians, all three hold 
a PhD in a subarea of collective health. In our experience, 
not only has collective health devoted substantial 
interest to primary healthcare as a public policy, but also 
the Brazilian medical community has not devoted much 
interest to primary care as a locus of healthcare delivery. 
For example, searching for (‘family medicine’ OR ‘family 
and community medicine’) in the SciELO Brazil collection, 
one of the top five journals is on medical education 
and the other four are journals on collective health. This 
suggests most research on primary healthcare in Brazil 
to be on health policy, service management and health 
promotion, as well as medical education, but not so much 
on clinical care. 

Most medical residencies, specialist certifications, 
master’s and PhD degrees happened in the Southeast

and South regions. The reason is twofold: these are two 
of the most populous regions (together with the Northeast 
region), and are the most economically developed 
ones. These facts also reflect in the overall distribution 
of physicians in Brazil.44 Interestingly, our data do not 
support a higher probability of obtaining a master’s or 
PhD degree for family and community physicians specialising 
or obtaining a master’s degree in the Southeast and 
South regions. This is not to say our data support equity in 
access to postgraduate programmes: there simply are too 
few family and community physicians outside the Southeast 
and South regions for us to make precise estimates. 
As the saying goes, ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of 
absence (of effect)’.45 

On the other hand, the association of gender and 
postgraduate degrees was very clear: female family and 
community physicians are less likely to obtain master’s 
degrees than their male colleagues, and even less so for 
PhD degrees. This should not be interpreted as gender 
having a direct effect on educational achievement: our 
study was exploratory, and inclusion of gender as an 
explanatory variable was motivated mostly by the SAGER 
(Sex and Gender Equity in Research) guidelines.46 
Rather, this finding should be taken as justification

and PhD degrees of family and community physicians in

for further studies, aimed at a more proper explanation 
for this correlation. Such an explanation might 
have more to do with family and community medicine 
than with the Brazilian society at large, because half 
the master’s and PhD graduates in Brazil are women.47 
Besides the ethical relevance of elucidating and preferably 
removing any gendered barriers to postgraduate 
education, the issue has special relevance to the discipline 
because most family and community physicians 
are women. 

In interpreting our findings, one must keep in mind 
we depended on administrative data. Because data from 
Conselho Federal de Medicina (CFM; the Federal Board of 
Medicine) is not available to others, we could not perform 
record linkage to identify who had retired, emigrated or 
deceased. The National Registration of Specialists was 
expected to provide easy access to an authoritative list 
of physicians in any medical specialty but, unfortunately, 
it has not been maintained as prescribed by the More 
Doctors Law.48 Consequently, the number of family and 
community physicians is surely overestimated, even if we 
expect this overestimation to be minor because family and 
community medicine is a fairly young specialty in Brazil.44 
In 2018, Augusto et al23 (using the same methods as us) 
estimated there would be 5,438 family and community 
physicians in Brazil, 276 (5%) more than the 5,162 found 
by Scheffer et al,44 who had access to CFM data. Another 
limitation of our study was that, as in Augusto et al,23 we 
could not include the family and community physicians 
who completed their medical residencies in the 1970s. 
SisCNRM records for family and community medicine 
(then community general medicine) begin at 1981, when 
the specialty was recognised; we can only hope family and 
community physicians from the 1970s eventually took the 
exams and were certified after 2003. 

Our data had limitations concerning postgraduate 
programmes, as well. Postgraduate degrees will probably 
have been underreported to some extent, even though 
postgraduate students are incentivised to have a CV in 
the Lattes Platform and entering data on a postgraduate 
degree is simple enough. Furthermore, there surely was 
some information error in the reported degrees, but we 
hope to have cleaned most of those errors during our 
verification. One potential issue is that we verified the 
data using current information on the postgraduate 
programmes, not information from when the degrees 
were obtained; but much of the information is not 
expected to change in any significant way, and possible 
changes in the knowledge subarea or specialty of the 
postgraduate programmes would not matter for our analysis, 
which was done at the level of basic knowledge area. 
Finally, because the Lattes Platform was launched in 1999, 
master’s and PhD degrees earned before are expected to 
be underreported, even if this underreporting is expected 
to occur mostly among those who do not make much use 
of the degrees. 

CONCLUSION 

Family and community physicians in Brazil increasingly 
earn academic and professional master’s and PhD 
degrees, with an emphasis on collective health, even 
though women seemingly face barriers to advance their 
education. The consequences of different postgraduate 
trajectories on professional performance and primary 
care research are unknown. We suggest it would be 
easier to gain a wider view of postgraduate education of 
primary care providers and/or on primary healthcare if 
the National Registration of Specialists came back online, 
and if primary healthcare and/or family and community 
medicine were recognised as knowledge areas.
