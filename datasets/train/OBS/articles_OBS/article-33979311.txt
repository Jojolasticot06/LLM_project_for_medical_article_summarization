Introduction  
Rotator cuff disease (RCD) is the most common cause of shoulder disability,1–4 but studies identifying risk factors for symptomatic disease have been sparse. Prevention strategies aimed at high risk groups could dramatically impact healthcare given the economic burden of treating painful RCD.5,6  Accumulating evidence indicates that familial predisposition influences degenerative RCD risk.7–10 However, knowledge of specific RCD genetic markers is limited. Studies have evaluated candidate genes and discovered associations with genes involved in repair and degenerative processes, including genes expressed in response to tissue damage.11–13 The first genome wide association study (GWAS) for RCD detected two associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in apoptosis,14 but this study of <350 RCD patients had limited statistical power. A second GWAS was unable to replicate associations from the first, and identified a new SNP associated with RCD.15 While this study was much larger (8,357 rotator cuff injury cases), the definition for RCD was non-specific, using ICD codes that might capture shoulder pain from other diseases.15  Uncertainty still exists about which genetic markers have true associations with degenerative RCD. The UK Biobank population of half a million people with genotype data provided a unique opportunity for a large GWAS with carefully defined RCD cases and controls to identify additional genetic markers and further evaluate the replicability of previous findings. 
Methods  
Our study population was derived from UK Biobank, a population-based prospective cohort of approximately 500,000 United Kingdom residents.16,17 Participants aged 40–69 years were recruited nationwide from 2006–2010 through invitations mailed to people registered with the National Health Service (NHS).18 At enrollment participants gave informed consent and whole blood samples were collected. NHS hospital records were linked to UK Biobank providing information on inpatient diagnoses and procedures during 2006–2017. Diagnoses were coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10). Procedures were coded using the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification, 4th revision (OPCS-4). DNA was extracted from whole blood samples and genotyped using the UK Biobank Axiom Array, which includes 812,428 SNPs and insertion-deletion markers.17,19 An additional 73 million markers were imputed using a reference haplotype panel to predict genetic markers not directly assayed. We obtained de-identified data from UK Biobank (project number 27034) on 488,292 UK Biobank participants with available genotype results. Of these, 968 participants were excluded because of poor quality results indicated by either extreme heterozygosity or missingness.17  Within the remaining 487,324 people we selected cases and controls. As >94% of participants self-reported European/white ancestry, the case-control population was limited to this group to reduce population stratification. Numerous quality control (QC) measures were undertaken to confirm data quality of the selected case-control sample.20,21 People were excluded if there was discordance between their reported and genetic sex, or a typed autosomal call rate <0.95. Population principal components (PCs) were used to infer shared ancestry.22 Individuals who reported European/white ancestry, but whose PCs did not cluster with the British ancestry cohort were excluded.17 We included individuals whose first three PCs were near the mean of this British cluster, namely within one third the full range of that PC across populations. Related pairs up to a third degree were provided by UK Biobank. To facilitate GWAS methods that assume unrelated individuals, one person from each related pair was excluded. When a pair contained a case (as defined below) and a non-case, the non-case was preferentially excluded. Otherwise, one person was excluded at random. The remaining subcohort formed the population from which cases and controls were selected.  Degenerative RCD cases were identified based on a primary or secondary ICD-10 diagnosis code of M75.1. To reduce risk of misdiagnosis, RCD cases were included only if a diagnosis was made by a trauma/orthopedics specialist and an accompanying surgical procedure consistent with RCD treatment was present. As genetic factors are considered important primarily for degenerative RCD, cases were excluded if they occurred concurrently with traumatic injury diagnoses (ex. shoulder dislocation).  Five controls were randomly selected for each case through incidence-density sampling, in which controls are randomly chosen from individuals in follow-up without a prior degenerative RCD diagnosis at the time of case diagnosis. Incidence-density sampling ensures a representative sample population with comparable follow-up for cases and controls.23,24 Follow-up was defined as time since enrollment in UK Biobank. Controls were matched to cases by age and reported sex.  The NHS Research Ethics Committee approved the UK Biobank. The Washington University Institutional Review Board determined this study to be exempt from oversight.  We included genetic variants that did not diverge from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with a p-value<1×10−6 and that had a minor allele frequency (MAF) >0.004285. The MAF cut-off was based on the formula 25/(2*number of cases) so ≥25 minor alleles would be expected in cases under the null hypothesis. Only imputed variants with an INFO score ≥0.3 were included to remove variants with low confidence imputed values.  Association tests used logistic regression to model genotype dosage effects on RCD, with covariates for age, sex, follow-up time, and the first 10 population PCs.22 QQ-plots were graphed and a genomic inflation factor calculated to check for bias. We required a genome-wide significance threshold of 5×10−8.20,25 For regions harboring GWAS significant signals, we performed an adjusted analysis using the lead SNP as a covariate to detect additional independent signals. We also specifically examined genetic markers identified as significantly associated with RCD in prior literature.11–15,26–30 For these markers a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value<0.05 and an odds ratio (OR) indicating an association in the same direction as the original publication were considered evidence of replication. PLINK (v1.9 and v2.0) was used for data cleaning and analysis.31,32  For genome-wide significant variants identified in initial analyses, several sensitivity analyses were undertaken. First, associations were estimated using the same cases and a larger set of controls defined as all non-cases in UK Biobank who met the quality control standards outlined above. Second, associations were estimated using conditional logistic regression to incorporate individuals selected multiple times as controls through incidence-density sampling and more precisely adjust for matching criteria. Third, associations were estimated in the subgroup of cases ≤60 years old at RCD surgery (and corresponding controls), as we hypothesized that genetic predisposition could lead to earlier-onset disease.  
Results  
Of the 487,324 people with usable genotype information, 28,072 people reported non-white ancestry (Figure 1). We excluded 364 people with a typed autosomal call rate <0.95, 357 people with discordance between reported and genetic sex, and 78,859 people to eliminate relatedness up to the 3rd degree. Thirty-one people were excluded based on population PCs.    In the remaining 379,641 people, we identified 2,917 degenerative RCD surgery cases. For cases, diagnoses occurred after a median 5 years of follow-up (interquartile range=3–6 years, range=0–10 years). The median diagnosis age was 65 years old (interquartile range=59–69, range=41–78), and 48% of cases were women (Table 1). Cases were follow-up, age, and sex-matched with a 1:5 ratio to 14,158 unique controls. For conditional logistic regression to represent incidence-density sampling, some individuals could be selected as controls multiple times, giving 14,547 controls.  Initially, over 77 million typed and imputed variants were available for analyses. Of these, >66 million were removed because of MAF<0.004285 and 50,998 were removed because of a Hardy-Weinberg exact test p-value<1×10−6. There remained 674,405 typed and 10,140,917 imputed variants included in analyses.  The Q-Q plot and genomic inflation factor of 1.02 provided no evidence for bias after accounting for matching factors and the first 10 PCs (Figure 2).  
  We observed one novel genome-wide significant signal (p-value=4.04×10−8) at SNP rs2237352 in the CREB5 gene on chromosome 7 (OR=1.17, 95%CI=1.11–1.24, Table 2, Figure 3). SNP rs2237352 was imputed with a high degree of confidence (INFO score=0.9847) and is a common variant (MAF=46.8%). The second strongest signal was for imputed SNP rs12700903 in the CREB5 gene (OR=1.17, 95%CI=1.11–1.24, p-value=5.63×10−8), which is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs2237352 (r2 = 0.98). Thus both SNPs represent the same statistical signal. The most significant directly assayed SNP in the CREB5 gene was rs66539057, but the association was not significant at a genome-wide level (OR=1.16, 95%CI=1.09–1.23, p-value=1.29×10−6). Figure 4 shows a detailed view of the associated region, with the lead SNP rs2237352 having strong to moderate LD with additional SNPs in the region.33 The strongest signal for a SNP having modest LD with rs2237352 was for rs4722837 (OR=0.86, p-value=1.26E-7, r2=0.38 with rs2237352).Results were similar in conditional logistic regression (rs2237352 OR=1.17, 95%CI=1.10–1.24; rs12700903 OR=1.17, 95%CI=1.10–1.24, Table 2).  After analyses adjusting for rs2237352 genotype, no additional SNPs in the region showed strong association (lowest p-value within 500Kb was 1.5×10−4).  We did not detect genome-wide significant signals at 28 loci associated with RCD in other studies. Two SNPs, rs820218 in the SAP30BP gene and rs2277698 at the TIMP2 gene, were associated with RCD surgery with a nominal p-value<0.05 (rs820218 OR=0.93, 95%CI=0.88–0.99, p-value=0.025; rs2277698 OR=0.87, 95%CI=0.80–0.95, p-value=0.002, Table 3). However, for rs2277698 the association was in the opposite direction as in the prior study. After Bonferroni-adjustment for 28 replication attempts, neither SNP remained significant.    After expanding controls to include the larger, unmatched cohort of non-cases (N=375,560), rs2237352 remained genome-wide significant (p-value=2.29×10−8, Table 2). Additionally, the rs12700903 association with degenerative RCD surgery became genome-wide significant (p-value=3.69×10−8).  There were 735 cases ≤60 years old at diagnosis and 3602 corresponding controls. Within this subgroup, associations with rs2237352 and rs12700903 were not genome wide-significant due to reduced statistical power. Odds ratios were slightly larger (rs2237352 OR=1.22, 95%CI=1.09–1.37, p-value=0.0006; rs12700903 OR=1.23, 95%CI=1.09–1.38, p-value=0.0005). 
Discussion  
We conducted a large, population-based GWAS of degenerative RCD surgery with well-defined cases and identified a novel association with a common SNP in the CREB5 gene. SNP associations from prior RCD studies did not replicate in our population after multiple test correction. These findings highlight the need for further large GWAS of degenerative RCD focused on carefully defining case and control status and identifying replicable results.  We identified a novel association between SNP rs2237352 and degenerative RCD surgery. SNP rs12700903 was also associated with degenerative RCD surgery after expansion of our control group, and represents the same signal as SNP rs2237352. Both SNPs are located on the CREB5 gene, which encodes a protein that is part of the cAMP response element-binding protein family.34 CREB5 is a transcription factor involved in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation.35,36 CREB5 expression has been associated with plasma interleukin-6 levels and may influence inflammatory response genes.37 As CREB family proteins influence expression of other genes,38,39 there may be numerous genetic mutations that could influence the same biologic pathways. If further research confirms this association, one would expect genetic risk for RCD to be highly polygenic as is common for most complex traits. Differential CREB5 expression has also been specifically documented in fibroblasts,40 lending further evidence that mutations in this gene could be of importance for tendon injury and repair.  After adjusting for rs2237352 in models, no additional signals were detected, consistent with this region harboring one primary locus associated with degenerative RCD. CREB5 SNPs in weaker LD with the top signal did not provide GWAS-significant evidence for another distinct signal in the region. However, this locus could represent an accumulation of weak effects from linked variants that influence degenerative RCD.41 Notably, as rs2237352 is an intron variant, it may be indicative of an unknown genetic determinant with which it co-segregates.  Most prior RCD genetic epidemiology studies have been candidate gene studies, while two GWAS RCD studies in independent populations have been conducted.10,13,15 Candidate gene studies focus on specific genes with known function potentially related to rotator cuff degeneration, whereas GWAS studies take an agnostic approach to testing association with large portions of the genome. Of the 28 SNPs from prior studies that we could evaluate in UK Biobank, only 1 demonstrated an association in UK Biobank in the same direction as the prior study with a nominal, uncorrected P<0.05 (rs820218), while none reached genome-wide significance. SNP rs820218 is located on the SAP30BP gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator protein involved in cell death and apoptosis.14,42 Numerous studies have shown increased tendon cell apoptosis related to rotator cuff tearing.43–45 However, as only 1 SNP out of 28 demonstrated a consistent association, this could indicate a chance replication.  Other findings were not replicated in our study. These discrepancies could be due to initial findings being due to chance, or could result from differences in case definitions. As our cases were specifically drawn from surgical cases in a hospital, they likely represent more severe disease than cases in studies capturing all confirmed rotator cuff tears in an orthopaedic clinical setting. For SNPs reported from candidate gene studies, we were unable to replicate associations at the P<0.05 level. Candidate gene studies have had limited success in identifying large portions of the genetic contributions to other complex diseases, and can be more susceptible to publication bias.46–48  One other genetic RCD study has recently been conducted in UK Biobank, which used a less specific case definition that appeared to include primary care diagnoses without treatment information.49 The associated SNPs in our study were not identified as having genome-wide significant signals in that study. Instead, three other associated SNPs were identified. These SNPs in the GLCCI1, THSD7A, and ZNF804A genes showed similar associations in our results that were not genome-wide significant (ex. for variant in GLCC1 gene: odds ratio of 0.88 vs. 0.89 in our study with P-value=2.84×10−4). The contrasting results likely reflect differing case definitions. The other study’s less stringent definition could capture cases that represent alternate sources of shoulder pain given preliminary diagnoses of RCD, while we expect our cases to disproportionately capture severe disease.  There are important limitations to the current study. First, we could not confirm rotator cuff tears with MRI or ultrasound as shoulder imaging was not available within UK Biobank. Relatedly, our control group could include people with asymptomatic tears or symptomatic tears being treated conservatively or in an outpatient setting. The prevalence of shoulder conditions in the UK primary care setting is reported to be 16–26% with most relating to rotator cuff tendon problems.50,51 We also could not differentiate between genetic effects that influence tear initiation, progression in tear severity, and pain tolerance. We did not have information on treatment outcomes and so could not evaluate how genetics influenced surgical outcomes. As is usual for GWAS results, the associated SNPs might not be directly causal, but instead merely correlated with functionally significant variants. Finally, as our analyses were limited to the white/European-ancestry population, further studies in non-European ancestry populations will be important in the future to examine the generalizability of our results.  Our study also had numerous strengths. This is one of the largest genetic RCD studies that has been conducted to date.15 Our incorporation of diagnostic, procedure, and provider specialty information likely made our case definition more specific than other large RCD GWAS,15,49 and we did not appear to be substantially under-capturing RCD surgery cases based on rates in the literature.52 A large number of genetic markers were available for examination, including typed markers and markers imputed with a high degree of confidence. This strength of UK Biobank will improve further in the future as plans are in place for whole genome sequencing of the population.53  A more comprehensive understanding of genetic susceptibility for degenerative RCD could aid treatment and prevention in several ways. First, someone with a genetic predisposition for RCD could derive greater benefits from changing modifiable risk factors such as smoking or occupational burdens. Second, a predisposition for cuff degeneration may also indicate impaired ability of the cuff to heal following surgical repair, which could influence cuff repair indications. Third, genetic susceptibility markers may point to key biological pathways in cuff degeneration that could direct future basic science research leading to novel therapeutics.  We identified a novel SNP in the CREB5 gene associated with degenerative RCD surgery in a general population sample of the United Kingdom. Further replication of this finding will be important in the future. Future examination of the genetic determinants of other chronic tendon disorders, including investigation of commonalities across such disorders, would be useful. The extensive information available in UK Biobank could allow future evaluation of risk models incorporating genetics, non-genetic characteristics, and gene-environment interactions.54 Identification of potentially important genetic markers in our study and others can allow a more focused study of these markers in smaller cohorts with more detailed clinical information, including investigations of how genetic factors may influence RCD progression and outcomes after surgical treatment.
