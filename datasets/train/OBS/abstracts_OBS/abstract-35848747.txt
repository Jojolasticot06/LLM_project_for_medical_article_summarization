OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between olfactory function and cognition 
in patients and rodents.
BACKGROUND: Perioperative neurocognitive disorders include delayed 
neurocognitive recovery (dNCR). The contribution of olfactory function to dNCR 
remains undetermined. It is unknown whether odor enrichment could mitigate dNCR.
METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study to determine 
potential association between olfactory impairment and dNCR in patients. We 
assessed the effects of anesthesia/surgery on olfactory and cognitive function 
in mice using the block test and Barnes maze. We measured interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
olfactory mature protein, growth-associated protein 43, mature and premature 
olfactory neurons, postsynaptic density 95, and synaptophysin in blood, nasal 
epithelium, and hippocampus of mice. Odor enrichment, IL-6 antibody, and 
knockout of IL-6 were used in the interaction experiments.
RESULTS: Patients with dNCR had worse odor identification than the patients 
without dNCR [preoperative: 7 (1.25, 9) vs 10 (8, 11), median (interquartile 
range), P <0.001; postoperative: 8 (2.25, 10) vs 10 (8, 11), P <0.001]. 
Olfactory impairment associated with dNCR in patients before and after adjusting 
age, sex, education, preoperative mini-mental state examination score, and days 
of the neuropsychological tests. Anesthesia/surgery induced olfactory and 
cognitive impairment, increased levels of IL-6 in blood and nasal epithelium, 
decreased amounts of olfactory receptor neurons and their markers in the nasal 
epithelium, and reduced amounts of synapse markers in the hippocampus of mice. 
These changes were attenuated by odor enrichment and IL-6 antibody.
CONCLUSION: The anesthesia/surgery-induced olfactory impairment may contribute 
to dNCR in patients and postoperative cognitive impairment in mice. Odor 
enrichment could be a potential intervention.
