Infectious keratitis is a sight-threatening condition that is usually an ocular emergency. The visual outcome depends on prompt and accurate clinical management as well as geographic and epidemiological awareness. We conducted a retrospective observational study to define the epidemiological and laboratory profile, as well as the clinical course of bacterial keratitis in a tertiary hospital in São Paulo over 21 years. Information about age, sex, predisposing factors, topical and surgical treatment, visual acuity, ulcers' classification, bacterioscopy, culture, and antibiotic sensitivity tests were collected. This study included 160 patients. The mean age was 65.1 ± 18.4 years and risk factors were identified in 83.1 % of the patients. Empirical topical fortified cephalosporin with an aminoglycoside or fourth-generation fluoroquinolone was curative for 66.2 % of the cases. The mean treatment duration was 22.5 ± 9 days. The mean variation of visual acuity was -0.25 logMAR, p < 0.001. Culture revealed 64 % of Gram-positive bacteria. All Gram-positive bacteria were sensitive to cephalothin, vancomycin, and quinolones. All Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and ciprofloxacin. These findings reinforce the importance of prompt empirical treatment of severe corneal ulcers with a fortified cephalosporin and aminoglycoside or a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone as there are equally effective. Collected data was insufficient to evaluate resistance of ocular infections over time in this population.
