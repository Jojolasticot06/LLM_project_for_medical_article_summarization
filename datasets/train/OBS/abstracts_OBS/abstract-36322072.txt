OBJECTIVES: To evaluate serum dupilumab levels at 16 weeks of treatment and to 
explore the association of serum dupilumab levels with treatment response and 
adverse effects in patients with AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This clinical, prospective, observational 
cohort study used data from the prospective BioDay Registry including adult 
patients with AD who started dupilumab treatment and for whom a serum sample was 
available at 16 weeks of treatment. All patients were treated according to the 
BioDay protocol in the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands. 
Patients received a loading dose of dupilumab 600 mg subcutaneously, followed by 
300 mg every other week. Patients who had a dose adjustment or discontinued 
treatment before 16 weeks of treatment were excluded. Data analyses were 
performed from January to June 2022.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Disease severity of AD was assessed at baseline and 
at weeks 16 and 52 using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). Treatment 
response was defined as the percent reduction in EASI score vs the baseline 
score (eg, EASI 90 indicated a 90% reduction) and as an absolute EASI cutoff 
score of 7 or lower (controlled AD). Adverse effects were recorded during the 
first year. At 16 weeks, dupilumab serum levels and treatment responses were 
measured and analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to 
determine the prediction of response (EASI 90; EASI ≤7) and adverse effects at 
52 weeks, with serum dupilumab levels at 16 weeks in the presence of the 
covariates age and sex.
RESULTS: Among the total of 295 patients with AD (mean [SD] age, 41.5 [15.9] 
years; 170 [57.6%] men), the median (IQR [range]) drug level was 86.6 μg/mL 
(64.6-110.0 μg/mL [10.1-382.0 μg/mL]) at 16 weeks of treatment. No significant 
differences were found in serum dupilumab levels between responder statuses 
(EASI, <50, 50, 75, or 90) at week 16. Multivariate logistic regression analysis 
showed nonsignificant odds ratios (ORs) for serum dupilumab levels at 16 weeks 
regarding prediction of long-term response (EASI ≥90: OR, 0.96 [95% CI, 
0.90-1.04; P = .34] and EASI ≤7: OR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.93-1.14; P = .55]) and 
adverse effects (OR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.95-1.07; P = .83]).
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: This prospective clinical cohort study found a broad 
range of serum dupilumab levels at 16 weeks of treatment and no association with 
treatment response and adverse effects during first year of treatment. Response 
may be dependent on target availability of the interleukin-4 receptor subunit α, 
with an interpatient variability producing heterogeneity in response.
