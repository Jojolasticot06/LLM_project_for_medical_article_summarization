Nudges are interventions promoting healthy behavior without forbidding options or substantial incentives; the Apple Watch, for example, encourages users to stand by delivering a notification if they have been sitting for the first 50 minutes of an hour. On the basis of 76 billion minutes of observational standing data from 160,000 subjects in the public Apple Heart and Movement Study, we estimate the causal effect of this notification using a regression discontinuity design for time series data with time-varying treatment. We show that the nudge increases the probability of standing by up to 43.9% and remains effective with time. The nudge's effectiveness increases with age and is independent of gender. Closing Apple Watch Activity Rings, a visualization of participants' daily progress in Move, Exercise, and Stand, further increases the nudge's impact. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of behavioral health interventions and introduces tools for investigating their causal effect from large-scale observations.
