1. Introduction
“Coronavirus disease 2019” (COVID-19), due to SARS-CoV-2 infection, primarily affects the lungs. From the beginning of the pandemic to early September 2022, approximately 615 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, among whom approximately 6.5 million died, worldwide [1]. Severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the two most severe forms of COVID-19. High-flow oxygen therapy is the first-line treatment of COVID-19-related severe hypoxemia [2], however, more than half of critically ill COVID-19 patients will require invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) affects between 29% and 64% of COVID-19 patients [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. VAP incidences of up to 84% have even been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients requiring ECMO [8]. To date, several pathophysiological hypotheses have been proposed to explain the particular vulnerability of COVID-19 patients to bacterial lung superinfection. However, the identification of risk factors of VAP, as well as the impact of VAP on the prognosis of severely SARS-CoV-2 infected patients is not fully documented. Previous reports based on small cohorts suggested that the male gender and the need for vasopressors are risk factors of VAP in COVID-19 [3], [9]. Additionally, the occurrence of VAP in ventilated COVID-19 patients did not seem to affect mortality [9], mainly driven by VAP-induced septic shock and ARDS [4].

Based on the analysis of the largest multicenter prospective cohort including 4929 critically-ill COVID-19 patients admitted into the ICU, the primary objectives of this study were to describe the incidence, characteristics, risk factors, and the prognosis of VAP in severe COVID-19 pneumonia; and secondly to describe the risk factors and the prognosis of early vs. late VAP, and Pseudomonas-related vs. non-Pseudomonas-related VAP.

2. Patients and methods
2.1. Study design
The multicenter prospective COVID-ICU cohort has previously been described [6]. Briefly, the study was conducted in 149 ICUs from 138 centers in France, Switzerland, and Belgium. Between February 25, 2020, and May 2, 2020, all consecutive patients over 16 years of age suffering from respiratory failure with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a participating ICU were prospectively included.

2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Were included in the current analysis all invasively mechanically ventilated (>48 h) patients of the COVID-ICU cohort. Were excluded patients who had been invasively ventilated for more than 24 h prior to a transfer into one of the participating centers.

2.3. Data collection
Full data collection has been previously described [6]. Briefly, data were retrieved via an electronic form, completed daily. A particular focus on patients’ respiratory support was made, regarding both the type of support and its settings. Records of additional treatments such as neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA), corticosteroids, etc. were collected. Recorded outcomes included time of weaning from IMV, time of ICU and hospital discharge, vital status at ICU and at hospital discharge, and vital status 28 and 90 days after ICU admission.

2.4. VAP definition
Only the first episode of bacterial VAP was considered when addressing the primary objectives. Regarding subgroup analyses, only the first episode of early and/or late VAP, and Pseudomonas-related and/or non-Pseudomonas-related VAP were considered.

VAP diagnosis was based on: (1) clinical and radiological suspicion based on the European Center of Disease Control criteria [10]; (2) confirmed by one positive microbiological sample defined when culture recovered ≥106 CFU.mL−1 for tracheal aspirate, ≥104 CFU.mL−1 for broncho–alveolar lavage, and ≥103 CFU.mL−1 for distal protected brush or aspirate [10]; (3) leading the attending physician to initiate an antimicrobial therapy. In addition, VAP must have occurred at least 48 h after the onset of IMV. Finally, pneumonia only related to Legionella pneumophila, mycoplasma, and chlamydia species, anaerobes, or isolated oro-pharyngeal flora were excluded from the analyses. Early and late VAP were defined as occurring < and ≥ 5 days respectively after the onset of IMV [11].

2.5. Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics of patients are described as counts (proportions) for categorical variables and median [1st–3rd quartiles] for quantitative variables.

Factors associated with the occurrence of VAP were identified using cause-specific Cox regression models, after checking the proportional-odds hypothesis and controlling for the competing risk of death. The at-risk period started 48 h after the onset of IMV. Factors associated with early and late VAP were identified in independent analyses using the same models. For early VAP, all patients were censored on day 5 following the onset of invasive mechanical ventilation. For late VAP, the at-risk period started 5 days after the onset of IMV in all patients still requiring IMV, and the occurrence of an early VAP was considered as a covariate. In another analysis, only Pseudomonas-related VAPs were considered, using the same statistical approach, with the occurrence of earlier non-Pseudomonas-related VAP considered as a covariate.

To determine whether the occurrence of VAP was associated with patients’ prognosis, Cox regression multivariable models were used to study the time to death or hospital/ICU discharge alive, considering the occurrence of a VAP as a time-dependent variable. For length-of-stay outcomes, death was considered as a competing event with the use of cause-specific models. For all regression analyses, a univariable analysis was conducted and a multivariable model for variables deemed clinically relevant was built, regardless of the univariable significant associations [12].

All tests were two-tailed and interpreted at the 0.05 significance threshold. All analyses were performed using the R statistical software version 4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

2.6. IRB approval
The study was approved by the French Intensive Care Society ethical committee (CE-SRLF 20-23). Due to the observational design and in accordance with French law [13], patients or next-of-kin of ICU non-survivors were informed that anonymized data regarding their hospital stay were collected in the database.

2.7. Reporting guidelines
This observational study follows the STROBE guidelines. STROBE checklist is provided as a Supplementary file.

3. Results
3.1. Patients
Over the study period, 4929 patients were included in the COVID-ICU database. Complete follow-up data were available for 4676 out of the 4929 patients, including 473 (10.1%) patients exclusively treated with standard oxygen therapy, 381 (8.1%) with high-flow oxygen therapy, and 156 (3.3%) with non-invasive ventilation. Among the remaining 3666 patients, 278 were ventilated for more than 24 h prior to admission into a participating ICU. Eventually, 3388 invasively ventilated patients were analyzed. According to the protocol, episodes only due to L. pneumophila (n = 1), mycoplasma and chlamydia species (n = 1), anaerobes (n = 8), or isolated oro-pharyngeal flora (n = 116) were not considered as VAP. Finally, 1523 (45.0%) patients fully analyzable presented at least one episode of VAP (Fig. 1).

Characteristics of patients and their clinical and biological data at ICU admission are available in Table 1. The median age was 63 [55–70] years. There were 2545/3388 (75.1%) male patients. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (48.9%) and diabetes (27.5%). There were 352 (10.4%) immunocompromised patients. Median time between the first COVID-19 symptoms and ICU admission was 7 [4–10] days. At admission, SOFA and SAPS-II scores were 10 [8–12] and 39 [30–52], respectively. Concomitant bacterial pneumonia has been diagnosed in 245 (7.2%) SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. There was no relevant difference regarding co-morbidities, and characteristics at admission and during the first 24 h following tracheal intubation between patients with and without subsequent VAP, except for the prevalence of diabetes and values of PaO2/FiO2 ratio (Table 1).

3.2. First VAP episode description and predictors
At least one episode of VAP occurred in 1523 (45.0%) patients, after a median of 7 [5–9] days of IMV. The cumulative probability of developing VAP is presented in Fig. A.1. Distribution of the bacteria isolated during the first episode of VAP is presented in Table 2. VAP was monomicrobial in 1263/1523 (82.9%) of cases. Among the 1814 bacterial species isolated, Enterobacteriaceae were found the most frequently, followed by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa.

Univariable and multivariable analyses of COVID-19-related VAP (C-VAP) predictors are reported in Table 3. After adjustment, variables independently associated with C-VAP were male gender (HR 1.26 95%CI [1.09–1.46], p = 0.002), concomitant bacterial pneumonia at ICU admission (HR 1.36 [1.10–1.67], p = 0.004), the severity of respiratory failure at the time of IMV initiation (HR 0.99 [0.98–0.99] per 10 mmHg increase of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, p = 0.001), NMBA use (HR 0.89 [0.76–0.998], p = 0.046), and corticosteroid use (HR 1.27 [1.09–1.47], p = 0.002).

3.3. Early and late VAP description and predictors
Among the 1523 patients that presented C-VAP, 491 (32.2%) patients presented an early VAP, and 1313 (86.2%) had at least one episode of late VAP. Distribution of the bacterial species isolated during early and late VAP is presented in Table A.1. S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae were isolated more frequently in early than in late VAP, while P. aeruginosa was isolated more frequently in late than in early VAP.

After adjustment, the only variable independently associated with early VAP was concomitant bacterial pneumonia at ICU admission (HR 1.51 [1.03–2.22], p = 0.04) (Table A.2), while variables independently associated with late VAP were male gender (HR 1.21 [1.03–1.44], p = 0.02), the severity of respiratory failure at the time of intubation (HR 0.99 [0.98–0.99] per 10 mmHg increase of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, p = 0.002), NMBA use (HR 0.84 [0.72–0.97], p = 0.02), and a previous episode of early VAP (HR 3.11 [2.64–3.67], p < 0.001) (Table A.3).

3.4. Pseudomonas-related VAP description and predictors
Among the 1523 patients that presented C-VAP, 656 (43.1%) presented at least one episode of Pseudomonas-related VAP. After adjustment, variables independently associated with Pseudomonas-related VAP occurrence were the use of prone positioning (HR 1.25 [1.02–1.53], p = 0.03) and a previous non-Pseudomonas-related VAP (HR 5.87 [4.74–7.27], p < 0.001) (Table A.4).

3.5. Patient outcomes and impact of VAP on prognosis
3.5.1. All VAP
Overall 28-day and 90-day mortality were 25.8% and 31.7%, respectively. Among survivors, the median length of IMV, ICU, and hospital stay were 17 [8–28], 19 [12–32], and 31 [19–49] days, respectively (Table 2). After adjustment for the other predictors of 90-day mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients [6], the occurrence of at least one episode of VAP was significantly associated with poor outcome (HR 1.34 [1.16–1.55], p < 0.001) (Table 4 and Fig. 2). VAP was also associated with higher ICU and hospital length-of-stay among survivors (Table 2 and Fig. A.2).

3.5.2. Early and late VAP
After adjustment, late VAP was independently associated with 90-day mortality (HR 1.51 [1.26–1.81], p < 0.001), while early VAP was not (HR 1.10 [0.91–1.32], p = 0.34) (Table A.5).

3.5.3. Pseudomonas-related VAP
The impact of Pseudomonas-related and non-Pseudomonas-related VAP on 90-day mortality was similar (HR 1.18 [0.99–1.40] and HR 1.18 [1.02–1.37], respectively) (Tables A.6A & B).

4. Discussion
4.1. VAP incidence and microbial ecology
In this prospective multicenter study, 45% of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients presented at least one episode of VAP. This result is in keeping with previous smaller reports, in which the incidence of C-VAP ranged from 30% to 60% [14]. However, this incidence is higher than reported in mixed non-COVID ICU patients, usually ranging from 10% to 25% [15], [16], and reaches similar incidences to those reported in trauma or brain injury [17]. Taking into consideration the severity of lung injury, this incidence remains higher than reported in patients with severe ARDS due to other causes [18], [19], including other viral ARDS [8], [20], [21]. This suggests the involvement of a specific mechanism related to COVID-19. It cannot be ruled out that the surge of severe patients, may have led to a decrease in vigilance and incomplete compliance with infection prevention measures [22]. Indeed, the surge of ICU patients led to work overload and understaffing (notably due to infection of healthcare workers), and consequently to hiring non-ICU nurses and increasing the patient-to-nurse ratio [23]. Moreover, nurses had to take care of more severe patients requiring more frequent invasive ventilation than before the first epidemic waves. In addition, closing the doors of patients’ rooms, the need to wear highly protective equipment to get in (and their possible shortage), and the possible fear of staff contamination contributed to decreasing the number of daily visits to patients [24]. Finally, ICU workers experienced high levels of stress and psychological burden, decreasing their vigilance and compliance with bundles of care for VAP prevention [25].

However, other pathophysiological features related to SARS-CoV-2 itself or to the excessive host inflammatory response may contribute to this increased susceptibility to bacterial superinfection, such as a large production of Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and IL-10 [26], [27], [28], lymphopenia [26], [29], decreased B and dendritic cells activation [30], decreased HLA-DR expression on lung macrophages [31], or expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [32].

Despite this increased incidence, the bacterial ecology reported in C-VAP appears close to that of non-COVID-19-related VAP (NC-VAP) [15]. Indeed, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus were the three main isolates, similar to the findings of a large European multicenter study [33]. Our results are also in keeping with those of previous smaller studies comparing bacterial ecology in C-VAP and NC-VAP [7], [34], [35]. Finally, we confirmed previous observations made both in NC-VAP [33] and C-VAP [9], reporting a greater proportion of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae, and less P. aeruginosa in early compared to late VAP.

4.2. VAP predictors
Among patient-related risk factors, only the male gender was independently associated with C-VAP in our study. This is in keeping with previous reports about NC-VAP [36], [37], [38] and C-VAP [3], [9]. Conversely, chronic renal and heart failures, COPD, diabetes, and immunodeficiency, frequently cited as NC-VAP risk factors [15], [39], were not associated with C-VAP. Regarding severity factors, we observed that the severity of hypoxemia at intubation was associated with a moderate additional risk of C-VAP, which is consistent with the previous identification of ARDS as a risk factor of NC-VAP [15], [39]. In contrast with several small-size studies [40], [41] and randomized controlled trials [42], steroids use was associated with C-VAP in this study, as previously suggested in NC-VAP [15]. However, due to the design of the study, we cannot rule out the participation of non-respiratory organ failure in this result, notably of associated septic shock, which is both a potential indication for hydrocortisone therapy and a risk factor of VAP [37], [43]. In addition, the effect of steroids on the incidence of VAP may vary during ICU stay, with an increased risk being reported for patients hospitalized for at least 14 days in the ICU [44]. Conversely, NMBA use was associated with a reduced incidence of C-VAP in this study. This is an unexpected result as a large recent study showed a 2.5-fold increased risk of NC-VAP with NMBA use, even after adjustment for the severity of the ARDS [38]. Thus, further studies are needed to determine if early administration of NMBA could be a protective factor in C-VAP. NMBA may prevent patient self-induced lung injury (P-SILI) by removing the strong inspiratory efforts arising from the high respiratory drive frequently observed in COVID-19 patients [45], which may favor VAP by worsening lung injuries and prolonging the duration of IMV.

Finally, the parameter associated with VAP with the highest hazard ratio was concomitant bacterial pneumonia at ICU admission, which occurred in 7.2% of patients. This incidence, lower than for other viral ARDS such as influenza-related ARDS, is consistent with previous reports [46], [47]. The risk of VAP may in part be explained by a more dysregulated inflammation in case of bacterial co-infection, favoring subsequent superinfection. This is in keeping with the higher mortality observed in COVID-19 intubated patients suffering from concomitant bacterial infection [47], similar to that reported in other respiratory viral-bacterial co-infections [48].

4.3. VAP impact on the outcome
The negative impact of VAP on mortality is established in general ICU patients [16], [49] and in patients suffering from influenza pneumonia [50]. However, the impact of C-VAP on mortality is still a matter of debate. Nseir et al. reported a 1.7-fold increase in 28-day mortality due to C-VAP [50], while Gamberini et al. did not observe any significant excess in mortality either for early or late C-VAP [51]. The crude mortality rates of patients with and without VAP in our study must not be directly compared due to the immortal time bias leading to underestimating mortality in patients with VAP. The Cox regression analysis accounting for competing risk of death and time-varying history of VAP controlled this bias and confirmed that the occurrence of C-VAP was associated with higher mortality (HR 1.34 [1.16–1.55]). These estimates are somewhat smaller than those reported by Nseir et al. Moreover, we observed different results for early and late C-VAP, only the latter being significantly associated with increased 90-day mortality. Gamberini et al. previously reported a detrimental impact of late rather than early C-VAP on weaning from IMV, although no effect on mortality was observed, possibly due to a lack of power. In addition, landmark analyses suggested that VAP-related excess in mortality is of particular concern during the first 15 days following intubation. Indeed, the cumulative probability of death at day 90 no longer differed between patients with and without C-VAP as soon as VAP occurred 15 days or more after intubation, suggesting that beyond this time point the adverse effect of VAP may be overcome by other factors affecting patients with a prolonged ICU stay. Finally, we observed a similar impact on mortality of Pseudomonas-related and non-Pseudomonas-related C-VAP, confirming in C-VAP the absence of specific risk due to Pseudomonas recently reported in NC-VAP [49].

5. Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge, this study is the largest cohort of ICU COVID-19 patients with VAP. Thanks to the detailed data available in the COVID-ICU database, we were able to perform a comprehensive risk factor analysis and adjust prognostic analyses on a large number of variables already known to impact COVID-19 patients’ mortality. Moreover, the Cox regression models used for prognostic analyses allowed us to estimate the specific association of VAP with mortality independently of the ventilation time already elapsed at the time of VAP onset. Thus, our study adds to current knowledge the identification of C-VAP risk factors and definitely confirmed the link between developing VAP and over-mortality during critical COVID-19.

We acknowledge several limitations to our study. First, all patients were included during the first epidemic wave of SARS-CoV-2 affecting Europe in the spring of 2020. Thus, it cannot be excluded that recent features including the acquisition of immunity following successive epidemic waves or vaccination, or the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, may change some of our results. Second, collected data did not allow us to precisely describe the bacterial ecology of C-VAP, for instance regarding the distribution of species within the Enterobacteriaceae family, or to provide antibiotic susceptibility and resistance profiles. Finally, although this study was conducted in 149 ICUs from 138 centers, across three countries, our results were obtained from a west European population. Since genetic predispositions to VAP and ethnical quantitative and qualitative variations in immune function have been described [39], further large studies are needed to confirm our results in different populations.

6. Conclusion
Patients with critical COVID-19 requiring IMV are especially exposed to the risk of VAP, in particular if they are males, present a bacterial pneumonia concomitantly with COVID-19, suffer from severe hypoxemic respiratory failure, and are treated with corticosteroids. C-VAP is independently associated with 90-day mortality and ICU morbidity, mainly due to the effect of late-VAP occurring before the 3rd week of ICU stay. A potential protective effect of NMBA use at the early stage of ventilation of critical COVID-19 patients requiring IMV deserves further investigations.
