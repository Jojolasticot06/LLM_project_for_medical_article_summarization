1/BACKGROUND: An understanding of whether early-life depression is associated with physical multimorbidity could be instrumental for the development of preventive measures and the integrated management of depression. We therefore aimed to map out the cumulative incidence of physical multimorbidity over adulthood, and to determine the association between the presence of depressive symptoms during early adulthood and the development of physical multimorbidity in middle age. 
2/METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we used pooled data from the 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS). Cohort waves were pooled in each decade of adult life available (when cohort members were aged 26 years in the BCS and 23 years in the NCDS [baseline]; 34 years in the BCS and 33 years in the NCDS [age 34 BCS/33 NCDS]; 42 years in the BCS and NCDS [age 42 BCS/NCDS]; and 46 years in the BCS and 50 years in the NCDS [age 46 BCS/50 NCDS]). We included participants who had completed the nine-item Malaise Inventory at baseline, and did not have a history of physical multimorbidity, any physical multimorbidity at baseline, or the presence of depressive symptoms before the development of physical multimorbidity. The presence of depressive symptoms was determined using the nine-item Malaise Inventory (cutoff score ≥4). Physical multimorbidity was defined as having at least two measures of any of the following ten self-reported groups of long-term conditions: asthma or bronchitis; backache; bladder or kidney conditions; cancer; cardiovascular conditions; convulsions or epilepsy; diabetes; hearing conditions; migraine; and stomach, bowel, or gall conditions. Cumulative incidence (with 95% CI) of physical multimorbidity was calculated for each decade considered after baseline, with physical multimorbidity being assessed as both a dichotomous and categorical variable. The association between depressive symptoms and the development of physical multimorbidity was assessed using adjusted relative risk ratios (with 95% CIs). 
3/FINDINGS: Analyses included 15 845 participants, of whom 4001 (25·25%; 95% CI 24·57-25·93) had depressive symptoms at baseline and 11 844 (74·75%; 74·07-75·42) did not. The cumulative incidence of physical multimorbidity (dichotomous) ranged over the study period from 2263 (18·44%; 95% CI 17·75-18·14) of 12 273 participants at age 34 BCS/33 NCDS, to 4496 (42·90%; 41·95-43·85) of 10 481 participants at age 46 BCS/50 NCDS, and was consistently higher in participants with depressive symptoms at baseline. The adjusted relative risk of physical multimorbidity was higher in participants with depressive symptoms than in those without and remained stable over the study period (adjusted relative rate ratio 1·67, 95% CI 1·50-1·87, at age 34 BCS/33 NCDS; 1·63, 1·48-1·79, at age 42 BCS/NCDS; and 1·58, 1·43-1·73, at age 46 BCS/50 NCDS). 
4/INTERPRETATION: The presence of depressive symptoms during early adulthood is associated with an increased risk of the development of physical multimorbidity in middle age. Although further research about the drivers of this relationship is needed, these results could help to enhance the integrated management of individuals with depressive symptoms and the development of preventive strategies to reduce the effect and burden of physical multimorbidity.
