INTRODUCTION
As defined in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) annual report, asthma is
a heterogeneous disease, usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation
and a history of respiratory symptoms such as cough, wheezes, shortness
of breath, and chest tightness, together with variable expiratory airflow limitation.
1 It is the most common chronic disease of childhood and is a major source of
childhood health burden worldwide, affecting 10% to 12% of children.2-4 It is also a
prevalent respiratory disease among adults, affecting approximately 5% of men and
6.5% of women in the European Union.5
Asthma exacerbations represent a progressive deterioration of symptoms and
lung function with respect to the patient’s usual status.1 Although asthma control
can be reached in most cases within 1 year, data suggest that this is mostly achieved
at the cost of maximizing drug dosages (68% and 76% of patients receiving salmeterol/
fluticasone and fluticasone, respectively).6 Asthma exacerbations are associated
with substantial health and economic effects including acute emergency department
visits and occasional hospitalizations. Therefore, early diagnosis of an exacerbation
is important for proper management and symptom relief. The identification
and confirmation of an exacerbation is time sensitive, making efficient and effective
home monitoring vital. Supplementary pulmonary function tests measuring peak
expiratory flow (PEF) or forced expiratory volume in 1 second are available for
home use. Whereas these tests are appropriate for use by adults and school children,
they are not designed for use in children younger than 5 years of age.7,8

To achieve effective asthma management, patients should
be given the necessary tools to allow them to recognize and
respond to worsening asthma. Whereas GINA identifies continuous
sounds (wheezes, rhonchi) as crucial for exacerbation
detection,1 auscultatory changes have thus far been assessed
mainly by doctors during face-to-face meetings with patients.
In this study, we investigated an artificial intelligence
(AI)-aided home stethoscope, StethoMe (StethoMe sp. z
o.o.), which enables the detection of pathologic auscultatory
phenomena (including continuous sounds [wheezes and
rhonchi] and transient sounds [coarse and fine crackles])
automatically at home as well as the effective measurement
of other parameters such as heart rate (HR), respiratory rate
(RR), and inspiration-to-expiration duration ratio (I/E). The
aim of this study was to investigate which parameters are of
crucial importance in exacerbation detection and monitoring
of patients with asthma and to what extent a home AI-aided
stethoscope can support this process, especially in children,
for whom there is a lack of efficient tools. We assessed data
for a 6-month monitoring period of patients with asthma.
Examinations were performed at home using an AI-aided
home stethoscope, PEF (when possible) and peripheral capillary
oxygen saturation (SpO2) measurements, and additional
survey information.
METHODS
Study Design
We conducted an observational study of patients of
various ages with asthma. We monitored asthmarelated
physiologic parameters (Table 1) at home
for 6 months. Each patient (or parent) was required
to perform health status (self-)examinations using
a home stethoscope, peak flow meter, and pulse
oximeter and indicate additional symptoms, including
subjective breathing quality, and collect data as
listed in Table 1, Figure 1, and Figure 2. The data
were gathered with a dedicated smartphone application.
Before the data collection process, each patient
(or parent) was trained with respect to correct
device usage and registration of all data in the provided
mobile application. All information was sent to
a platform accessed by physicians who analyzed the
data to identify exacerbation occurrences.
According to the research protocol, for the first
14 days, 1 examination (collection of a set of recordings
from auscultation points on the chest performed
≥30 minutes after administration of asthma control
drugs) per day was required, followed by ≥1 examination
per week for the remaining duration of the
program. When exacerbation or any alarming symptoms
occurred, the participant was obliged to perform
examinations twice a day. When determined
by the physician assigned, participants were asked to
perform additional examinations.
Participants
The patient consent form and the approval from the Poznań
University of Medical Sciences Bioethics Committee are
shown in Supplemental Appendix 1 and Supplemental
Appendix 2, respectively. Patients were recruited from the
general Slavic population via advertisements and recruitment
efforts conducted by medical centers. The inclusion criterion
for children and adults was diagnosed asthma (primary or
secondary care). In younger children, suspicion of asthma
was also accepted. Any other comorbidities that might affect
asthma assessment or influence the measured parameters
constituted exclusion criteria. Each participant underwent
individual evaluation, during which a physician assessed their
eligibility for inclusion in the study. Neither season nor pollen
activity were factors considered for selection; however, the
majority of participants collected data during the autumn.
A total of 149 patients participated in the study. Among
the 6,442 complete examinations, which included a total of
41,872 recordings, 6.4% did not meet quality criteria and were
not analyzed further; exclusion was determined by StethoMe
AI on the basis of inadequate quality of the majority of recordings
for an examination. All remaining examinations were
labeled by physicians, and 282 examinations from 54 patients
were identified as moderate or severe exacerbations (Table 2).
Equipment
We used standard certified medical devices, including
pulse oximeters (Accurate FS20P, Accurate FS20C [Hunan Accurate Bio-Medical Technology Co, Ltd]) and peak flow
meters (Mini Wright Peak Flow and Low Range [Clement
Clarke International]), to collect SpO2 and PEF measurements.
Other parameters were measured with the European
Conformity (CE)-certified StethoMe stethoscope, which
records auscultatory sounds from standard chest points
(Figure 1) and transfers sound files wirelessly to a dedicated
mobile phone application. The recordings were automatically
analyzed by the AI module, and results (pathologic
auscultatory sound intensities, HR, RR, I/E) were displayed
in the application. In addition, the user provided other health
state information in a survey in the mobile telephone application
(Figure 2).
We used StethoMe AI for automatic analysis of auscultatory
recordings and aggregation of results for each
examination (set of recordings from multiple auscultatory
points on the chest). StethoMe AI has shown high effectiveness
in respiratory sound recognition9-13; it was trained using
>10,000 recordings of respiratory sounds (see Grzywalski
et al9 for details) and is clinically validated and CE certified
as a Class IIa medical device in Europe. This AI module is a
specialized artificial neural network (NN) suitable for polyphonic
sound event detection. It is composed of a dozen
specialized layers of neurons, including many convolutional
layers, which are effective at detecting local patterns in the
signal, and several recurrent layers designed to capture longtime
dependencies (eg, a patient’s breathing cycle and the
associated recurrence of pathologic sounds). The network
contains a total of 7.4 million trainable parameters. For output,
the NN provides a matrix termed the probability raster.
Figure 1. Auscultation points on the chest according to age group: (A) <12 years of age, (B) >12 years of age.

In this data structure, the columns represent time, discretized
into 10-ms frames, and the rows indicate the probability of
phenomena (ie, wheezes, rhonchi, coarse and fine crackles)
detection changing over the frames. The probability values
provided by the NN are thresholded to obtain Boolean
values indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon
in each frame.
Sufficient quality of captured sounds was ensured by an
inherent mechanism incorporated within the StethoMe AI.
The quality assurance process relied on the following 2 primary
factors: (1) the detection of the presence of breathing
cycles, and (2) the absence of excessive background noise.
Examination quality was then determined by evaluating
the individual recordings. Quality assessment results were
immediately available to patients on completion of the examination.
In the case of rejection, users were encouraged to
repeat auscultation for the low-quality points.
Reference Standard
Data were analyzed by physicians who assessed the asthma
exacerbation level (none, mild, moderate, severe) for
each examination. The assessment was carried out at the

examination level rather than the recording level. A total of
17 physicians with different specializations were involved
in this process (2 internal medicine specialists, 4 pulmonologists,
9 pediatricians, 5 allergologists, 4 family medicine
specialists [some had a double specialization]), each
assessing examinations performed by participants assigned
exclusively to them. Each physician took into account all
of the information generated by the participant (Table 1),
listened to each auscultation recording, and analyzed the
spectrogram (Supplemental Figure 1). Data from prior
examinations were also available. These assessed examinations
were considered the reference standard and were used
to develop and evaluate the performance of machine learning
classifiers.

Data Analysis
All experiments and data analyses were carried out using
Python 3.8 (Python Software Foundation) extended with the
following packages: numpy version 1.19.5, scikit-learn version
1.0.2, scipy version 1.7.1, and pandas version 1.3.1. The raw
data are accessible in Supplemental Appendix 3 in the form
of a comma-separated values file.
We used the collected data to evaluate the effectiveness
of different user-registered parameters (Table 1) for autonomous
detection of asthma exacerbation. For this purpose, 12
feature sets were defined, each including patient age, gender,
an identifier physician assessing the exacerbation level, and
≥1 user-registered parameters from Table 1. For each evaluated
set, a random forest regressor (RFR) was fitted to the
reference standard exacerbation levels mapped to a scale
from 0 to 1.0 (none: 0; mild: 1/3; moderate: 2/3; severe: 1).
Each RFR consisted of 100 decision trees trained using the
squared error criterion and without constraining their maximum
depth. For quantitative evaluation of the performance of
the RFR, we rescaled the model’s prediction labels from the
4-point scale to binary values by thresholding at 0.5 (values
>0.5 were mapped to 1, and values <0.5 were mapped to 0)
so as to predict the existence of at least moderate exacerbation
level, as identified by the physician’s labels. The model’s
area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
(AUC) achieved on a held-out test
set was used as a measure of the
effectiveness of each considered
feature set in the detection of
asthma exacerbation.14-20 Each feature
set was evaluated in a 10-fold
cross-validation experiment, and
each experiment was repeated 20
times to estimate the feature set’s
mean AUC and 95% CIs. In each
fold of the cross-validation process,
the data set was categorized into
a training set comprising 90% of
patients. This training set was used
to construct the RFR decision trees.
In addition, a test set consisting
of 10% of patients was created to
evaluate the performance of the
final model. Given that an individual’s
data were never used for
training and evaluation of the same
RFR, the results show true model
performance for patients not seen
by the model.
We selected the RFR model as
the predictor for exacerbation level
on the basis of a series of preliminary
experiments. These experiments
involved testing various
alternative models including decision
trees; support vector regressors with linear, radial basis
function, and sigmoid kernels; multilayer perceptrons; adaptive
boosting (AdaBoost); gradient-boosting regressors; and
their ensembles. After thorough evaluation, we selected the
RFR primarily because of its consistent performance across
different subsets of analyzed features and fast computation. In
addition, we optimized the meta-parameters of the RFR model
using an automated machine learning method. We found that
the optimal forest only marginally outperformed the default
forest when evaluated on the held-out test set. As a result, we
decided to retain the default RFR metaparameters.
RESULTS
Figure 3 shows the ROC curves obtained for the classifiers.
To determine a standard performance measure, we calculated
AUCs (Table 3 and Figure 4). Considering the ROC curves,
the shapes for the different parameters and sets of parameters
differed, which was reflected in the AUC values. For children,
the ROCs with greatest curvature were obtained for the classifiers
that used all provided input data (combination of all
StethoMe AI analysis results, PEF, SpO2, and survey data) as
well as those that used only data provided by the AI-aided
stethoscope (4 pathologic sound intensities, HR, RR, and I/E)
(shown in red and pink, respectively, in Figure 3), resulting

in the greatest AUC values (younger children: 93.2% [95%
CI, 92.1%-94.4%] and 93.0% [95% CI, 92.1%-93.9%], respectively;
older children: 92.4% [95% CI, 90.9%-93.9%] and
92.4% [95% CI, 91.1%-93.7%]) (Table 3). For adults, the survey
data performance (symptoms) was quantitatively similar
to that of the curve corresponding to the use of all input data
(AUCs 92.0% [95% CI, 89.4%-94.6%] and 93.7% [95% CI,
92.1%-95.3%], respectively), whereas the set of parameters
provided by the AI-aided stethoscope (pink curve) was more
flattened (AUC 81.0% [95% CI, 75.1%-86.8%]). In addition,
all of the data depicted by single parameters (HR, RR,
I/E, PEF, and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation) were
relatively close to the diagonal of the plot (Figure 3), suggesting
poor performance of these parameters in classification
tasks for all age groups (AUCs close to or <70%). The most
efficient single value parameters were continuous respiratory
sounds (wheezes and rhonchi, orange curves). In this case, the
AUC values were the lowest for adults (approximately 70%),
whereas they reached approximately 80% for children.
DISCUSSION
Given that the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma is most
challenging in children, especially younger children,21 this
group was of paramount importance in this study, and we
therefore discuss the findings for this group first. The Global
Initiative for Asthma suggests that in children younger than 5
years of age, the evaluation of exacerbations should be based
mainly on subjective assessment of the patient’s condition.
Interestingly, Figures 3 and 4 clearly show that the subjective
information noted by parents was not sufficient to confirm
or exclude the appearance of an exacerbation (AUC 72.0%
[95% CI, 70.1%-73.9%]) (Table 3). Our findings are consistent
with prior research showing inconsistency in assessment
between parents and doctors.22 Home monitoring of children
is therefore strongly biased by the subjective assessment of
lay persons (parents), and thus far there has been no tool to
objectivize this. Our present results indicate that using a single-
parameter approach, the determination of exacerbation is
ambiguous, that is, PEF, SpO2, HR, RR, and I/E measurements
appear to be relatively weak indicators of exacerbation in all
groups of patients. Our findings are in line with the results
of Muñoz-López23 and Brand et al,24 who suggest that during
treatment, the PEF variation over time shows poor concordance
with changes in other parameters of asthma severity. In
addition, some authors suggest poor performance of HR and
RR as determinants of acute asthma severity,25 which is confirmed
by the present study. Constrained to single parameters,
we found that continuous auscultatory sounds are more effective,
with the AUC reaching approximately 80% for children.

Only incorporation of several parameters into a single
classifier appeared to be sufficient to detect exacerbations
in children. The data provided by AI-aided stethoscopes
(including survey), together with PEF and SpO2, performed
the best in identifying asthma exacerbation in all groups;
nevertheless in both children groups, equally high efficiency
was obtained when considering the parameters provided by
AI-aided stethoscope alone. This means that using AI-aided
stethoscopes facilitates the detection of exacerbations with
high effectiveness even in children younger than 5 years of
age. Our present results strengthen the statements by Priftis
et al26 and the Consensus Document of the Emilia-Romagna
Asthma Study Group27 and are in line with the priorities for
future research into asthma diagnostic tools given by the
European asthma research innovation partnership.28
In contrast, in adults, the key to effective diagnosis of an
exacerbation was patient reporting of disease-specific symptoms
(Figures 3 and 4). Adding other parameters (AI-aided
stethoscope data, PEF, and SpO2) only slightly improved performance.
One might therefore state that adults can precisely
describe their health status, and it can be difficult for parents
when describing their children’s health status.
Regarding needs and recommendations for the future, it
should be noted that asthma management is becoming much
more patient specific.29 Therefore, AI-aided stethoscopes
are a particularly useful tool that can be applied to optimize
and improve patient-doctor collaboration using telemedicine
solutions. It has been reported that telehealth programs have
strong potential with regard to asthma-related health outcome
improvement,30 increased access to care,27,28 and cost
effectiveness.31,32 Currently, it is possible to send medical
records via the internet and also to preanalyze them using AI
modules. Still, there are no exact guidelines on how to objectively
monitor aspects other than apparent asthma symptoms
at home. As a result, establishing a definitive action plan is
particularly challenging for younger children, owing to the
limitations of conducting standard physiologic tests such as
peak-flow measurements or spirometry. Our present results
suggest that the use of AI-aided home stethoscopes might fill
this gap by monitoring a broader set of parameters.
Strengths and Limitations
The present results are based on large-scale data gathered
from intended-use cases by certified medical devices, thus
their reliability, especially considering home use, is much
greater than that of a laboratory study with a limited number
of participants and short-term monitoring. It is important
to highlight that currently there are no definitive objective
parameters or a specific set of objective parameters that can
unequivocally confirm asthma exacerbation. The identification
of asthma exacerbation relies on symptoms and indirect
measures rather than concrete biomarkers. Thus, the reference
standard we used was also established on the basis of the
experience and subjective decisions of individual physicians.
Nevertheless, this is fully consistent with the current clinical
approach to asthma exacerbation detection. Finally, the present
study focused solely on Slavic patients; however, there are
no available data from GINA indicating any ethnic influence
on exacerbation detection.
Conclusions
The present results clearly show that a set of parameters
(wheezes, rhonchi, coarse and fine crackles, HR, RR, I/E)
measured by a device such as an AI-aided home stethoscope
allows for the detection of exacerbations without the need
for performing PEF measurements, which can be equivocal.
In addition, in the case of younger children (aged <5 years),
when introduced on a large scale, the analyzed home stethoscope
appears to be a promising tool that might make asthma
diagnosis more straightforward and substantially facilitate
asthma monitoring.
