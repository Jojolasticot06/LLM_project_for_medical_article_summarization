INTRODUCTION: To elucidate the postnatal dynamics and clinical associations of 
fecal calprotectin (FC) in very preterm infants, with a focus on necrotizing 
enterocolitis (NEC) and feeding intolerance (FI).
METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cohort study in infants with a 
gestational age of <32 weeks or birth weight <1,500 g with weekly feces 
collection. The relationships between FC, NEC, and FI were investigated, 
adjusting for demographic and clinical factors.
RESULTS: A total of 1,086 fecal samples were collected from 194 preterm infants. 
Postnatal FC levels of non-NEC infants were highly variable and followed an 
age-dependent patterned progression. FC levels were elevated in patients with 
NEC before and at NEC onset, distinguishing them from non-NEC infants and those 
at sepsis onset. Among infants without NEC or sepsis, those with FI exhibited 
lower FC concentrations throughout hospitalization and displayed a significant 
delay in reaching high FC levels after meconium compared with non-FI infants. 
The age to reach the first high nonmeconial FC levels was positively associated 
with the time to achieve full enteral feeding.
DISCUSSION: Postnatal FC dynamics among premature infants followed a patterned 
progression but were disturbed in patients with NEC and FI. Because of the high 
variations, the use of FC levels in NEC diagnosis should be implemented with 
caution in clinical practice. FC may help understand FI and feeding progression 
in very preterm infants. Further research is needed to validate these findings 
and explore the potential clinical applications of FC in this population.
