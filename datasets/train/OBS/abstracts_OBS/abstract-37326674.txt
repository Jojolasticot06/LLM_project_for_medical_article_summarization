1/ This observational study aimed to determine whether individuals with 
fibromyalgia (FM) exhibit higher levels of neuroinflammation than healthy 
controls (HCs), as measured with positron emission tomography using [ 18 
F]DPA-714, a second-generation radioligand for the translocator protein (TSPO). 
2/ Fifteen women with FM and 10 HCs underwent neuroimaging. Distribution volume (V 
T ) was calculated for in 28 regions of interest (ROIs) using Logan graphical 
analysis and compared between groups using multiple linear regressions. 
3/ Group (FM vs HC) was the main predictor of interest and TSPO binding status (high- vs 
mixed-affinity) was added as a covariate. The FM group had higher V T in the 
right postcentral gyrus ( b = 0.477, P = 0.033), right occipital gray matter 
(GM; b = 0.438, P = 0.039), and the right temporal GM ( b = 0.466, P = 0.042). 
The FM group also had lower V T than HCs in the left isthmus of the cingulate 
gyrus ( b = -0.553, P = 0.014). In the subgroup of high-affinity binders, the FM 
group had higher V T in the bilateral precuneus, postcentral gyrus, parietal GM, 
occipital GM, and supramarginal gyrus. Group differences in the right parietal 
GM were associated with decreased quality of life, higher pain severity and 
interference, and cognitive problems. 
4/ In support of our hypothesis, we found increased radioligand binding (V T ) in the FM group compared with HCs in 
several brain regions regardless of participants' TSPO binding status. The ROIs 
overlapped with prior reports of increased TSPO binding in FM. Overall, 
increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that FM involves microglia-mediated 
neuroinflammation in the brain.
