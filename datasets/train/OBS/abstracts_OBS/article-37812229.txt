Introduction 

Treatments provided to severely ill or injured patients 
in intensive care units (ICUs) have increased patient 
survival [1–3]. Yet, current use of less sedation makes 
patients more awake [4], alert, and prone to bothersome 
symptoms. A more focused attention to patients’ 
symptoms may be the first step to improving recovery 
after ICU treatment or, when treatments fail, to providing 
a more peaceful death. As symptoms, by definition, 
are perceived experiences, providing patients the 

opportunity to report their symptoms is the gold standard 
for symptom assessment [5]. 

Recent studies have described various symptoms and 
discomforts in a variety of ICU populations [6, 7]. However 
some studies have only evaluated a single symptom 
or symptom intensity which does not capture the complexity 
of symptoms; some use retrospective designs, particularly 
problematic when attempting to elicit patients’ 
real-time experiences [6–9]. Other studies had extensive 
exclusion criteria, reducing the potential to generalize 
results to the general ICU patient population [10]. Overall, 
studies reporting symptoms from the first days in 
the ICU are scarce [8, 11]. ICU admissions are stressful 
in nature and associated with unclear clinical situations, 
several procedures, and therefore potentially represent a 
high risk of unrelieved symptoms [12–14]. 

Over 10 years ago, Puntillo and colleagues assessed the 
prevalence, intensity and distress of ten symptoms in a 
heterogeneous group of ICU patients, laying the groundwork 
for future, more extensive symptom studies [11]. 
What is unknown is the current status of ICU patient 
symptom experiences and factors that can potentially 
predict the intensity of certain symptoms [11, 15]. Therefore, 
the main aim of this study was to describe several 
dimensions (i.e., prevalence, intensity and distress) of five 
symptoms recommended for daily assessment [16] (i.e., 
thirst, pain, anxiousness, tiredness, shortness of breath) 
in a heterogeneous ICU population, over seven days. The 
secondary aim was to investigate associations between 
intensity of the five symptoms and selected demographic 
and clinical variables which we anticipated to be associated 
with these symptoms over seven days. 

Methods 

Study design and setting 

This prospective cohort study was conducted as a multicenter 
observational study investigating symptoms in 
ICU patients and long-term outcomes during the first 
year after ICU admission (NCT 03714230). Patients were 
consecutively recruited from six medical and surgical 
ICU departments from two hospitals in Norway between 
October 2018 and June 2020. 

The study was performed in accordance with the 
ethical principles for medical research as written in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent for 
study participation was obtained from patients or temporarily 
from their family members until patients were 
able to consent. Patients who died before self-consent 
was obtained were retained in the study. Regional Committee 
for Medical Research Ethics approved the study 
(Approval number 2017/990-1), as did data protection 
officers at the respectively hospitals. The present 

Take-home message

assessments of symptoms are warranted and clinicians should initiate 
symptom relief measures to improve patient comfort. 

study adheres to the reporting guidelines according to 
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies 
in Epidemiology (STROBE) [17]. 

Study population 

ICU patients were included if they were above 18 years 
of age and had one of these inclusion criteria; need 
for mechanical ventilation (MV), need for continuous 
vasoactive therapy or ICU stay greater than 24 h. 
All patients that met the inclusion criteria were consecutively 
enrolled in the study, and daily symptom 
assessments were started immediately using self-report 
when possible, or proxy-reporting by bed-side nurse. 
If patients did not want to participate when they were 
capable of self-report and give consent, all data on 
these patients were deleted. Only patient self-reported 
data were used in the present study. Patients were 
excluded if they had a predefined cognitive deficit as 
described in the medical chart (e.g., dementia), were 
homeless, unable to read and write Norwegian, admitted 
for organ preservation, or were re-admitted to the 
ICU within 72 h. 

Outcome 

The study outcome was self-reported symptom information 
measured on day one and during seven days 
using the Patient Symptom Survey (PSS) [11]. Sample 1 
contains patients with only symptom assessments from 
day one; Sample 2 contains patients with assessments 
during seven days (including day 1). First day in the 
ICU was defined as the day of admission, or for those 
who were admitted late in the afternoon, the following 
day (first full day). 

Data collection 

Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) on physical 
and mental health information prior to ICU (pre-ICU 
data) were retrieved from patients after their study inclusion 
in the ICU. During the ICU stay patients were asked 
to rate their symptoms once a day for seven days. Clinical 
variables were retrieved from medical records. Either 
patients or family members reported information about 
patients’ demographics. 

Pre-ICU data 

Frailty was measured with Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) 
where patients gave a subjective judgement on their 
health status prior to ICU admission [18]. Frailty is 
described with nine classes, from very fit to terminally 

ill. This tool has shown to be valid and reliable and easy 
to use, even in young critically ill patients [19]. CFS was 
divided into three categories: non-frail, pre-frail and frail 
[20]. Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was calculated 
and used to determine patients’ pre comorbidity profile 
[21]. 
Patients’ levels of anxiety and depression prior to ICU 
admission was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (HADS) [22]. The scale consists of 14 
items, with two subscales including seven questions 
each: HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A), and HADS Depression 
(HADS-D). Both are scored with a Likert scale (0–3). 
Total scores for each subscales range from 0 to 21. Each 
subscale indicates states of anxiety or depression, with a 
cut-off score = 
8 indicate states of anxiety and depression 
[23]. The HADS has shown good psychometric properties 
in patients admitted in an acute medical unit in Norway 
[24]. 

Demographic and clinical data 

Demographic data were age, sex, education, co-habitation 
and work situation. Data on patient visitations from 
family members (within four hours of assessment) and 
medication use (i.e., opioids or sedatives, yes/no) administered 
within six hours before assessment were collected 
from medical charts. Level of alertness or agitation was 
classified according to the Richmond Agitation-Sedation 
Scale (RASS) completed during symptom assessments by 
the study nurse [25]. For intensity of illness we collected 
data on Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II) 

[26] from medical records. Data on type of ICU admission 
(i.e., surgical or medical) and primary cause of ICU 
admission (e.g., respiratory, circulatory, gastroenterological) 
were collected from medical records in addition to 
data on invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and non-
invasive mechanical ventilation (NIV). 
Symptom assessment 

Symptoms were assessed using the PSS symptom 
checklist, a ten-item list of symptoms developed from 
the validated Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale 
and adjusted for ICU populations [11]. Puntillo and colleagues 
tested face validity of the 10-item checklist in a 
previous pilot study, and responders were able to differentiate 
between symptoms and ranges of intensity and 
distress [27]. Later, face validity was established when 
delirious and nondelirious patients could differentiate 
between the presence or absence of symptoms and 

symptom intensity and distress [11]. For the present 
study, we selected five symptoms (i.e., pain, thirst, anxiousness, 
tiredness and shortness of breath) from the 
original PSS to increase feasibility of data collection, 
as recommended by Chanques et.al. [16]. The modified 
checklist with five symptoms was pilot-tested for face 
validity and feasibility in Norwegian ICU patients by 
the research group. Patients were asked to score their 
symptoms in the present moment. Intensity was measured 
on a Likert scale from 0 to 10 (0 = 
no intensity, 
10 = 
worst intensity possible) and distress from 0–10 
(0 = 
no distress, 10 = 
the most distress possible). All 
members of the research team were trained to ensure 
consistency of symptom assessment and reporting. The 
training was repeated during the data collection, to 
ensure compliance with the procedure. 

Statistical analyses 

Categorical data are described as counts and percentages, 
and continuous data are presented as mean and standard 
deviation (SD) (normally distributed data) or median and 
interquartile range (IQR) (data with skewed distribution). 

As the same patients were able to report for up to seven 
days and thus there were statistical dependent, we fitted 
multivariate linear regressions models using the generalized 
estimating equation (GEE) method. GEE allows for 
randomly missing data at different time points, e.g. no 
imputation is necessary [28]. 

One model was fitted for each of the selected symptoms. 
The models examined the associations between 
each of the five symptoms (i.e., thirst, pain, anxiousness, 
tiredness and shortness of breath) as the dependent variables 
and the same list of possible predictive factors (i.e., 
age, sex, SAPS II, CCI, Frailty score, primary cause of 
ICU admission, type of ICU admission, HADS-A total 
score, HADS-D total score, level of education, MV treatment, 
analgesic administration, sedative administration, 
visits during ICU stay). The selection of these possible 
predictive factors was based on empirical and clinical 
considerations, and determined by consensus of the 
research team. 

Our selected covariates and outcome variables were 
assessed over seven days. GEE models estimate the 
overall impact of a covariate assessed over a given 
time period on the outcome averaged over the same 
time period. Thus, we estimated an average effect of a 
covariate on an average level of the outcome. 

Each symptom was coded zero if a patient did not 
have the symptom, and any assessment above zero 
(1–10) was coded as the symptom intensity. Further, 
all symptom assessments during seven days were collapsed 
to one mean intensity score for each patient. 
In step one, univariate analyses were performed for 

Fig. 1 Flow diagram Fig. 1 Flow diagram 
all independent variables. In step two, variables with 
p-values = 
0.10 from the univariate analyses were 
included in the multivariate models, and the models 
were further adjusted for age and gender [29]. 
The results from the GEE models are presented with 
regression coefficients (estimated ß with 95% confidence 
intervals (CI)). P-values less than 0.05 were 
considered statistically significant in the multivariate 
models. Statistical analyses were performed using 
SPSS 28 for Windows (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). 

Results 

Patient characteristics 

In total, 1234 patients were eligible for inclusion, and 
603 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 195 patients 
could self-report symptoms the first ICU day (sample 1), 
and 353 patents could self-report symptoms one or several 
times during their ICU stay (sample 2) (Fig. 1), and 
thereby constitutes the two samples in the present study. 
For the seven days assessments, median age was 63 years 
(IQR 48–73), 60.3% were males, and the majority of these 
patients had a medical reason for admission (63.5%). 
There were 38.8% treated with IMV and 22.4% with NIV. 
Of the IMV patients, 18 were orally intubated during 
symptom assessments, five of them providing full symptom 
assessments (prevalence, intensity, distress) and 13 
patients were able to report only presence of symptoms 
(yes/no). The most frequent causes of ICU admission 

were respiratory (21.5%), circulatory (17.6%) and gastroenterological 
(16.7%) failure. Median ICU length of stay 
was 2.8 (IQR 1.7–5.2) days, and median SAPS II score 
was 38 (IQR 28–50). Sample 1 and Sample 2 were similar 
concerning clinical and demographic variables except 
for primary cause of ICU admission and time on IMV 
(Table 1). 

Prevalence, intensity and distress of symptoms on the first 
day in ICU (study sample 1) 

During the first day in the ICU, 195 patients were able 
to self-report symptoms (Table 2). Thirst was the most 
prevalent symptom (66%) and had the highest mean 
intensity score (6.13, 95%CI [5.7–6.56]). Anxiousness 
was the least prevalent symptom (24%), but it had the 
highest mean distress score (5.24, 95%CI [4.32–6.15]). 

Prevalence, intensity and distress of symptoms during seven 
days (study sample 2) 

During seven days, 353 patients self-reported symptoms 
668 times (median 2 assessments per patient) 
(Table 2). The majority of patients were discharged 
before day three (median ICU lenght of stay (LOS): 
2.8 days) explaining the low number of assessments 
per patients. 

Thirst was the most prevalent (64%) and most intense 
(6.05, 95%CI [5.81–6.3]) symptom. Anxiousness was

the symptom with the lowest prevalence (25%) during 
seven days but with the highest mean distress 
score (5.46, 95%CI [4.95–5.98]). Pain had the lowest 
mean intensity score (4.61, 95%CI [4.31–4.9]) and 
tiredness the lowest mean distress score (3.5, 95%CI 
[3.13–3.87]). 

Associations between intensity and possible predictive 
factors (study sample 2) 

The results from the multivariate GEE analysis of possible 
predictive factors for all five symptoms are listed in 
Tables 3a–e. The GEE model for thirst intensity revealed 
that both a sepsis diagnosis (B = 
1.71 95%CI [0.58–2.84]) 
and analgesic administration (B = 
0.88, 95%CI [0.18– 
1.59]) were associated with increased thirst intensity 
(Table 3a). 

Increased age (B =- 
0.04, 95%CI [- 
0.07 to - 
0.02]) 
was associated with decreased pain intensity. Receiving 
MV was associated with lower pain intensity scores 
(B =- 
0.9, 95%CI [- 
1.48 to - 
0.32]), and analgesic 
administration during the last six hours before symptom 
assessment was associated with higher pain intensity 
scores (B = 
1, 95%CI [0.49–1.5]) (Table 3b). 

Having visits from family membersduring ICU stay 
was associated with more anxiousness (B = 
0.64, 95%CI 
[0.04–1.24]) (Table 3c). Female sex was associated with 
increased shortness of breath (B = 
0.56, 95%CI [0–1.11]) 

Table 2 Prevalence, intensity and distress in the ICU 

(Table 3e). None of the selected possible predictive factors 
were associated with the intensity of tiredness in the 
multivariate analyses (Table 3d). 

Discussion 

The main finding of the present study was that the 
patients reported a consistently high symptom burden for 
up to seven days of ICU stay. The most prevalent symptom 
was thirst, followed by tiredness, pain, shortness 
of breath and anxiousness. Thirst was the most intense 
symptom, while being anxious was the most distressing 
symptom. Indeed, the almost equal symptom intensity 
score of 5 for all symptoms is believed to depict at least a 
moderate degree of intensity [30]. 

Previous thirst studies have reported thirst prevalence 
from 70% to 76% [11, 31–33], versus 64–67% in 
the present study. We found mean intensity thirst score 
to be 6.13 for each of the seven days. Different scales 
have been used to measure intensity scores for thirst 
in different studies. Puntillo et al. found a mean intensity 
scores at 2.16 of 3 [11], while a study by Negro et al. 
found a mean intensity score of 5.4 of 10 for thirst [33]. 
It is a paradox that thirst is the most prevalent and most 
intense symptom in ICU patients and still not routinely 
assessed or treated. One study found that oral care only 
affected the perception of thirst for one hour, underscoring 
the importance of offering frequent relief of thirst

[34]. Simple thirst bundles have shown to be efficient in 
increasing patient comfort [8, 35, 36]. Therefore, routine 
thirst assessment and treatment should be implemented 
in daily care [8, 37, 38]. 

Analgesic administration was associated with higher 
thirst intensity in this study. This finding is similar to 
a study by Stotts et al. that found thirst presence to be 
predicted by high opioid doses [15]. However, Lin et al. 
found that use of opioids was not a risk factor for thirst 
[31]. This discrepancy may be that different doses of opioids 
were used for pain management or that thirst was 
managed differently in those two studies. 

A surprising, and unexplained, result was that the diagnosis 
of sepsis was associated with increased thirst intensity. 
We could not investigate the effect of patient’s fluid 
balance on thirst due to incomplete data. However, Stotts 

et al. found no statistically significant differences in fluid 
balance between patients who reported thirst and those 
who did not [15]. 

Anxiousness was the least prevalent symptom in 
the present study, but it had the highest mean distress 
scores. According to the theory of unpleasant symptoms 
(TOUS), distress is the degree to which the person 
is bothered by a symptom [39]. This finding reinforces 
the importance of investigating multiple dimensions 
of symptoms and appreciate psychological aspects of a 
patient’s symptom experience. 

Surprisingly, we found that receiving visits from family 
members was associated with higher intensity score 
for anxiousness. In contrast, a recent systematic review 
and meta-analysis found that flexible visiting hours might 
reduce anxious symptoms [40]. Others found that being 

separated from family members were patients’ second 
most stressful experience [10]. We noted visits from family 
members in the four hours prior to data collection. 
Possibly patients felt more anxious after family had left, 
and this experience was associated with increased scores 
of anxiousness, or that anxious patients were those who 
had most visits. Another reason may be that patients 
have witnessed family members being worried by seeing 
the patients as sick. Because of this, the patient’s feeling 
of anxiousness increased. However, our unexplained 
finding about family visits should not encourage limitation 
of family visits, but should be further explored in 
future studies. 

Pain was reported by 36% of the patients in the present 
study, and patients who received analgesics reported 
higher pain intensity score than patients without such 
medications. One study found that being given opioids 
prior to a procedure was a risk factor for higher procedural 
pain intensity [12]. Yet, a recent study of procedural 
pain found contrary results [41]. We had only information 
about analgesic administered within six hours prior 
to pain assessment. Therefore, it is possible that pain had 
increased in the time between administration of analgesics 
and symptom assessments, the administration could 
have been too close to the symptom assessment, or the 
pain treatments could be inadequate. We also found that 
patients on MV reported less pain intensity. This finding 
is consistent with a recent study of ICU patients in Norway 
[41]. In the present study, 66% of the patients on MV 
received analgesics (data not shown), suggesting an association 
between MV and pain beyond the administration 
of analgesics. However, this relationship needs further 
exploration. 

Finally, we found that higher age was associated with 
less pain intensity. This finding is compatible with recent 
studies of ICU patients [14, 41]. However, two other studies 
showed conflicting results, where higher age was not 
associated with less pain intensity, for procedural pain 
and for critically ill patients [42, 43]. In summary, study 
populations and pain management practices differ, perhaps 
accounting for different results. 

Breathlessness is frequently reported as a distressing 
symptom by ICU patients and was reported by one third 
of the patients. Further, it is associated with anxiety in 
MV patients [44, 45]. Female sex was the only possible 
predictive factor associated with shortness of breath. 

Strength and limitations 

The study has some limitations. The symptoms were 
only assessed once a day; therefore, we do not know 
if there were variations of symptoms throughout 24 h. 
Further, using the same list of possible predictive factors 
in the GEE models limited our investigation of 

possible predictive factors specific to each symptom. 
Other factors may be investigated that explore treatment 
and nursing actions such as fluid balance, fluid 
restrictions and mobilization and the impact of symptoms 
on each other. Since this was a selected cohort of 
patients able to self-report symptoms one or several 
times during seven days, the result from the present 
study may not be generalized to all ICU patients. Nevertheless, 
we collected data prospectively from a large, 
heterogeneous sample of adult ICU patients in several 
ICUs and had a longer follow up of up to seven days. 

Conclusions 

Our study found that self-reporting ICU patients experienced 
a high and consistent symptom burden across 
seven days. Thirst was the most prevalent and intense 
symptom, but the other symptoms examined were also 
high in intensity. Certain factors are associated with 
the degree of symptom intensity and distress. Further 
research is warranted to better understand these associations 
and investigate symptom relief measures.
