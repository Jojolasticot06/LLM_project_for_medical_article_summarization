1/BACKGROUND: Patients with depression are more susceptible to cardiovascular illness including vascular surgeries. However, health outcomes after vascular surgery among patients with depression is unknown. This study aimed to investigate associations of depression with post-operative health outcomes for vascular surgical patients.
2/METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted using data from a large mental healthcare provider and linked national hospitalization data for the same south London geographic catchment. OPCS-4 codes were used to identify vascular procedures. Health outcomes were compared between those with/without depression including length of hospital stay (LOS), inpatient mortality, and 30 day emergency hospital readmissions. Predictors of these health outcomes were also assessed. 
3/RESULTS: Vascular surgery was received by 9,267 patients, including 446 diagnosed with depression. Patients with depression had a higher risk of emergency admission for vascular surgery (odds ratio [OR] 1.28; 1.03, 1.59), longer index LOS (IRR 1.38; 1.33-1.42), and a higher risk of 30-day emergency readmission (OR 1.82; 1.35-2.47). Patients with depression had higher inpatient mortality after adjustment for sociodemographic status (1.51; 1.03, 2.23) but not on full adjustment, and had longer emergency readmission LOS (1.13; 1.04, 1.22) after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and cardiovascular disease. Correlates of vascular surgery hospitalization among patients with depression included admission through emergency route for longer LOS, inpatient mortality, and 30-day hospital readmission. 
4/CONCLUSION: Patients with depression undergoing vascular surgery have substantially poorer health outcomes. Screening for depression prior to surgery might be indicated to target preventative measures.
