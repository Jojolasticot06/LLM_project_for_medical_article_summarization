Many studies have demonstrated the clinical utility and importance of epilepsy 
gene panel testing to confirm the specific aetiology of disease, enable 
appropriate therapeutic interventions, and inform accurate family counselling. 
Previously, SCN9A gene variants, in particular a c.1921A>T p.(Asn641Tyr) 
substitution, have been identified as a likely autosomal dominant cause of 
febrile seizures/febrile seizures plus and other monogenic seizure phenotypes 
indistinguishable from those associated with SCN1A, leading to inclusion of 
SCN9A on epilepsy gene testing panels. Here we present serendipitous findings of 
genetic studies that identify the SCN9A c.1921A>T p.(Asn641Tyr) variant at high 
frequency in the Amish community in the absence of such seizure phenotypes. 
Together with findings in UK Biobank these data refute an association of SCN9A 
with epilepsy, which has important clinical diagnostic implications.
