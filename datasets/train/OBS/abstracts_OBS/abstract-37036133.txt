1/BACKGROUND: Donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) testing is an emerging screening modality for noninvasive detection of acute rejection (AR). This study compared the testing accuracy for AR of two commercially available dd-cfDNA and gene-expression profiling (GEP) testing in heart transplant (HTx) recipients. 
2/METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study of HTx only patients who underwent standard and expanded single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) dd-cfDNA between October 2020 to January 2022. Comparison with GEP was also performed. Assays were compared for correlation, accurate classification, and prediction for AR. 
4/RESULTS: A total of 428 samples from 112 unique HTx patients were used for the study. A positive standard SNP correlated with the expanded SNP assay (p < .001). Both standard and expanded SNP tests showed low sensitivity (39%, p = 1.0) but high specificity (82% and 84%, p = 1.0) for AR. GEP did not improve sensitivity and showed worse specificity (p < .001) compared to standard dd-cfDNA. 
5/CONCLUSION: We found no significant difference between standard and expanded SNP assays in detecting AR. We show improved specificity without change in sensitivity using dd-cfDNA in place of GEP testing. Prospective controlled studies to address how to best implement dd-cfDNA testing into clinical practice are needed.
