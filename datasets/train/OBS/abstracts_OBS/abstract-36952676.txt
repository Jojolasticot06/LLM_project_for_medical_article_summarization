This observational study assessed key attributes of the hypertension 
surveillance system at Kenema Government Hospital, Kenema District, Sierra 
Leone. We administered semistructured questionnaires; reviewed hospital 
registers, patient charts, and the District Health Information Software 
database; and rated the implementation status of each attribute as poor (1-3), 
average (4-6), or good (7-10). Of the 7 attributes, simplicity, flexibility, and 
acceptability were good; stability was average, but timeliness, sensitivity, and 
data quality were poor. Overall, the usefulness of the hypertension surveillance 
system was poor, as it did not monitor hypertension trends, nor was it linked to 
public health action.
