OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of skeletal muscle mass on the 
rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.
DESIGN: A prospective, double-blinded, observational study.
SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital.
POPULATION: One hundred one patients aged 18-65 years who were scheduled to 
undergo major surgery lasting more than 1 h under general anaesthesia.
METHODS: All participants underwent body composition analysis before anaesthesia 
and were allocated into two groups; the muscular and non-muscular group, 
according to skeletal muscle mass. During anaesthesia induction, rocuronium 
1.0 mg kg-1 of total body weight was injected followed by neuromuscular 
monitoring using train-of-four stimulation every 15 s.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The onset time of rocuronium included the elapsed time 
from the rocuronium injection until 95% depression of first twitch (T1) and the 
time to no response to TOF stimulation. The duration was evaluated as the 
elapsed time from the rocuronium injection to 25% recovery of the final T1 
(TDUR25), and the time to the reappearance of T1 (TTOF1) and T4 (TTOF4). These 
pharmacologic data were compared between two groups.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the onset time of rocuronium 
between the two groups. However, TDUR25 (min) was significantly shorter in the 
muscular group than in the non-muscular group (p =  0.035 and p =  0.014 in 
males and females, respectively). TTOF1 and TTOF4 were also shorter in the 
muscular group than in the non-muscular group.
CONCLUSIONS: Total body weight-based dosing of rocuronium might prolong the 
neuromuscular relaxation effect in patients with a small amount of skeletal 
muscle.
