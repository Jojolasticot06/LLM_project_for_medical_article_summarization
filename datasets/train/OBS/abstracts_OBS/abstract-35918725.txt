BACKGROUND: In recent decades, it has been possible to observe an increase in 
Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) usage globally for both disease 
prevention and health promotion purposes. we aim to estimate the prevalence of 
CAM use and analyze associated factors in Brazil.
METHODS: Observational study with data from the 2019 National Health Survey that 
evaluated a sample of Brazilian adults. The outcome was CAM use, such as 
acupuncture, homeopathy, medicinal plants and herbal medicines, meditation, and 
yoga in the last 12 months. A logistic regression model with a 99% confidence 
interval was used to assess factors associated with CAM use.
RESULTS: The prevalence of CAM use in 2019 was 5.2% (CI99% = 4.8-5.6%), the most 
used modalities: medicinal plants and herbal medicines, with a prevalence of 
3.0% (CI99% = 2.7-3.33) followed by: acupuncture 1.4% (CI99% = 1.3-1.6) 
homeopathy 0.9% (CI99% = 0.7-1.0), meditation 0.7% (CI99% = 0.6-0.8) and yoga 
0.4% (CI99% = 0.4-0.5). We observed important geographical differences in CAM 
use in Brazil, with a higher prevalence in the North Region, 3.7% 
(CI99% = 2.81-4.75), where herbal medicines were more frequent the in the other 
regions. After estimating an adjusted model, women, older people, and people 
with a higher level of education and per capita income were the ones who used 
all types of CAM the most. The practice of yoga stands out among women 3.6% 
(CI99% = 2.49-5.28) and among individuals with higher per capita income 7.5% 
(CI99% = 2.97-18.93); meditation among individuals with higher educational level 
13.4% (CI99% = 6.41-28.33) and acupuncture for those who declared regular or 
poor health 1.9% (CI99% = 1.51-2.39).
CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that the Ministry of Health expand CAM access to 
Unified Health System users and promote health professionals' conscious and 
guided use for the Brazilian population.
