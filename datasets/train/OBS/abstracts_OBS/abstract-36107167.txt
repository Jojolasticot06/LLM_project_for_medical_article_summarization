1/PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to collect baseline growth parameters in   children with achondroplasia who might enroll in interventional trials of   vosoritide, and to establish a historical control.  
2/METHODS: In this prospective, observational study, participants (â‰¤17 years)   underwent a detailed medical history and physical examination and were followed   every 3 months until they finished participating in the study by enrolling in an   interventional trial or withdrawing.  
3/RESULTS: A total of 363 children were enrolled (28 centers, 8 countries). Mean   (SD) follow up was 20.4 (15.0) months. In participants <1 year, mean annualized   growth velocity (AGV) was 11.6 cm/year for girls and 14.6 cm/year for boys. By   age 1 year, mean AGV decreased to 7.4 cm/year in girls and 7.1 cm/year in boys.   By age 10 years, mean AGV decreased to 3.6 cm/year for both sexes. Mean height   z-score in participants <1 year was -2.5 for girls and -3.2 for boys and   decreased up to the age 5 years (-5.3 for girls; -4.6 for boys). Girls and boys   had a disproportionate upper-to-lower body segment ratio. Mean ratio was highest   in participants aged <1 year (2.9 for girls; 2.8 for boys) and decreased   gradually to approximately 2 in both sexes from 4 years of age onward.  
4/CONCLUSION: This study represents one of the largest datasets of prospectively   collected medical and longitudinal growth data in children with achondroplasia.   It serves as a robust historical control to measure therapeutic interventions   against and to further delineate the natural history of this condition.
