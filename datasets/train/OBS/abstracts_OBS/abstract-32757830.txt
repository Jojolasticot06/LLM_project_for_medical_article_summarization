Through quantitative and qualitative methods, in this article the authors 
describe the perspectives of indigenous women who received antenatal and 
childbirth medical care within a care model that incorporates a non-governmental 
organisation (NGO), Partners in Health. They discuss whether the NGO model 
better resolves the care-seeking process, including access to health care, 
compared with a standard model of care in government-subsidised health care 
units (setting of health services networks). Universal health coverage advocates 
access for the most disadvantaged and vulnerable populations as a priority. 
However, the issue of access includes problems related to the effect of certain 
structural social determinants that limit different aspects of the obstetric 
care process. The findings of this study show the need to modify the structure 
of organisational values in order to place users at the centre of medical care 
and ensure respect for their rights. The participation of agents outside the 
public system, such as NGOs, can be of great value for moving in this direction. 
Women's participation is also necessary for learning how they are being cared 
for and the extent to which they are satisfied with obstetric services. This 
research experience can be used for other countries with similar conditions.
