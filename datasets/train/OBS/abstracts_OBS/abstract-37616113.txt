Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Greece is among the highest across the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA), with high AMR rates even to last-line antibiotics. To better understand the clinical microbiology laboratory practices and capacities in species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) across public healthcare establishments in Greece, we sent a questionnaire to 98 of 128 public hospital microbiology laboratories between 1 February and 1 April 2022. Of the 73.5% (72/98) that responded, 51.4% (37/72) reported using EUCAST guidelines. Two of three laboratories used an automated instrument for species identification and AST for all laboratory samples. Broth microdilution for colistin susceptibility testing was used by 46 of the laboratories, more frequently in larger (> 400 beds) versus smaller (< 400 beds) hospitals (90.5% (19/21) vs 52.9% (27/51) respectively, p = 0.011). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was available in one of 10 laboratories, and more often in larger compared to smaller hospitals (p = 0.035). Although the majority of laboratories had a laboratory information system (LIS) in place, only half had the capacity to extract data directly from the LIS for the purpose of AMR surveillance; 73.6% (53/72) used restrictive antibiograms. Public microbiology laboratory AMR capacities in Greece require improvement, prioritising interventions for EUCAST guidelines implementation.
