OBJECTIVES: Optimal timing of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation in 
severe acute kidney injury (AKI) remains controversial. Initiation of treatment 
early in the course of AKI may lead to some patients undergoing unnecessary RRT, 
whereas delayed treatment is associated with increased mortality. This study 
aims to investigate whether the combination of the furosemide stress test (FST) 
and AKI-associated biomarkers can predict the development of indications for 
RRT.
DESIGN: Single-center, prospective, observational study.
SETTING: University Hospital of Muenster, Germany.
PATIENTS: Critically ill, postoperative patients with moderate AKI (Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes stage 2) and risk factors for further 
progression (vasopressors and/or mechanical ventilation) receiving an FST.
INTERVENTIONS: Sample collection and measurement of different biomarkers 
(chemokine [C-C motif] ligand 14 [CCL14], neutrophil gelatinase-associated 
lipocalin, dipeptidyl peptidase 3).
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was the development of 
greater than or equal to one predefined RRT indications (hyperkalemia [≥ 6 
mmol/L], diuretic-resistant hypervolemia, high urea serum levels [≥ 150 mg/dL], 
severe metabolic acidosis [pH ≤ 7.15], oliguria [urinary output < 200 mL/12 hr], 
or anuria). Two hundred eight patients were available for the primary analysis 
with 108 having a negative FST (urine output < 200 mL in 2 hr following FST). 
Ninety-eight patients (47%) met the primary endpoint, 82% in the FST negative 
cohort. At the time of inclusion, the combination of a negative FST test and 
high urinary CCL14 levels had a significantly higher predictive value for the 
primary endpoint with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUC) of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82-0.92) compared with FST or CCL14 alone (AUC, 0.79; 
95% CI, 0.74-0.85 and AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89; p < 0.001, respectively). 
Other biomarkers showed lower AUCs.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of the FST with the renal biomarker CCL14 predicts 
the development of indications for RRT.
