BACKGROUND: Pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in certain genes are linked to 
higher lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and can influence preventive 
surgery decisions and therapy choices. Public health programs offer genetic 
screening based on criteria designed to assess personal risk and identify 
individuals more likely to carry PGVs, dividing patients into screened and 
non-screened groups. How tumor biology and clinicopathological characteristics 
differ between these groups is understudied and could guide refinement of 
screening criteria.
METHODS: Six thousand six hundred sixty breast cancer patients diagnosed in 
South Sweden during 2010-2018 were included with available clinicopathological 
and RNA sequencing data, 900 (13.5%) of which had genes screened for PGVs 
through routine clinical screening programs. We compared characteristics of 
screened patients and tumors to non-screened patients, as well as between 
screened patients with (n = 124) and without (n = 776) PGVs.
RESULTS: Broadly, breast tumors in screened patients showed features of a more 
aggressive disease. However, few differences related to tumor biology or patient 
outcome remained significant after stratification by clinical subgroups or PAM50 
subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the subgroup most enriched for 
PGVs, showed the most differences between screening subpopulations (e.g., higher 
tumor proliferation in screened cases). Significant differences in PGV 
prevalence were found between clinical subgroups/molecular subtypes, e.g., TNBC 
cases were enriched for BRCA1 PGVs. In general, clinicopathological differences 
between screened and non-screened patients mimicked those between patients with 
and without PGVs, e.g., younger age at diagnosis for positive cases. However, 
differences in tumor biology/microenvironment such as immune cell composition 
were additionally seen within PGV carriers/non-carriers in ER + /HER2 - cases, 
but not between screening subpopulations in this subgroup.
CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of molecular tumor features in patients clinically 
screened and not screened for PGVs represents a relevant read-out of guideline 
criteria. The general lack of molecular differences between 
screened/non-screened patients after stratification by relevant breast cancer 
subsets questions the ability to improve the identification of screening 
candidates based on currently used patient and tumor characteristics, pointing 
us towards universal screening. Nevertheless, while that is not attained, 
molecular differences identified between PGV carriers/non-carriers suggest the 
possibility of further refining patient selection within certain patient subsets 
using RNA-seq through, e.g., gene signatures.
