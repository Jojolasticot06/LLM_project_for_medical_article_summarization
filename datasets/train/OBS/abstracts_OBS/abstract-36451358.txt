Human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has multiple neurological consequences, but 
its long-term effect on brain health is still uncertain. The cerebrovascular 
consequences of COVID-19 may also affect brain health. We studied the chronic 
effect of COVID-19 on cerebrovascular health, in relation to acute severity, 
adverse clinical outcomes and in contrast to control group data. Here we assess 
cerebrovascular health in 45 patients six months after hospitalisation for acute 
COVID-19 using the resting state fluctuation amplitudes (RSFA) from functional 
magnetic resonance imaging, in relation to disease severity and in contrast with 
42 controls. Acute COVID-19 severity was indexed by COVID-19 WHO Progression 
Scale, inflammatory and coagulatory biomarkers. Chronic widespread changes in 
frontoparietal RSFA were related to the severity of the acute COVID-19 episode. 
This relationship was not explained by chronic cardiorespiratory dysfunction, 
age, or sex. The level of cerebrovascular dysfunction was associated with 
cognitive, mental, and physical health at follow-up. The principal findings were 
consistent across univariate and multivariate approaches. The results indicate 
chronic cerebrovascular impairment following severe acute COVID-19, with the 
potential for long-term consequences on cognitive function and mental wellbeing.
