Dysbiosis of the female reproductive tract is closely associated with 
gynecologic diseases. Here, we aim to explore the association between dysbiosis 
in the genital tract and uterine fibroids (UFs) to further provide new insights 
into UF etiology. We present an observational study to profile vaginal and 
cervical microbiome from 29 women with UFs and 38 healthy women, and 125 samples 
were obtained and sequenced. By comparing the microbial profiles between 
different parts of the reproductive tract, there is no significant difference in 
microbial diversity between healthy subjects and UF patients. However, alpha 
diversity of UF patients was negatively correlated with the number of fibroids. 
Increased Firmicutes were observed in both the cervical and vaginal microbiome 
of UF patients at the phylum level. In differential analysis of relative 
abundance, some genera were shown to be significantly enriched (e.g., 
Erysipelatoclostridium, Mucispirillum, and Finegoldia) and depleted (e.g., 
Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and Sporolactobacillus) in UF patients. Furthermore, 
the microbial co-occurrence networks of UF patients showed lower connectivity 
and complexity, suggesting reduced interactions and stability of the cervical 
and vaginal microbiota in UF patients. In summary, our findings revealed the 
perturbation of microbiome in the presence of UFs and a distinct pattern of 
characteristic vaginal and cervical microbiome involved in UFs, offering new 
options to further improve prevention and management strategies.
