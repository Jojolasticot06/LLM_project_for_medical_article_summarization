1/BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is rising and increases patient healthcare costs due to extended hospitalisation, tests and medications. Management of CDI in French primary care is poorly reported. 
2/OBJECTIVES: To characterise patients suffering from CDI, managed in primary care and describe their clinical outcomes. 
3/METHODS: Retrospective observational study based on survey data among 500 randomly selected General Practitioners (GPs) surveyed in France from September 2018 to April 2019. GPs were asked to complete a multiple-choice questionnaire for each reported patient presenting a CDI. Responses were analysed according to clinical characteristics. Treatment strategies were compared according to the outcome: recovery or recurrent infection. 
4/RESULTS: Participation rate was 8.6% (n = 43/500) with two incomplete questionnaires. Data from 41 patients with an actual diagnosis of CDI were analysed. Recovery was observed in 61% of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CDI. In the recovery group, this was exclusively a primary episode, most patients (72%) had no comorbidities, were significantly younger (p = 0.02) than the ones who relapsed and 92% were successfully treated with oral metronidazole. Duration of diarrhoea after antimicrobial treatment initiation was significantly shorter in the recovery group (≤ 48 h) (p = 0.03). Cooperation with hospital specialists was reported in 28% of the recovery group versus 87.5% of the recurrent group (p = 0.0003). Overall, GPs managed successfully 82.9% of cases without need of hospital admission. 
5/CONCLUSION: GPs provide relevant ambulatory care for mild primary episodes of CDI using oral metronidazole. Persistent diarrhoea despite an appropriate anti-Clostridiodes regimen should be interpreted as an early predictor of relapse.
