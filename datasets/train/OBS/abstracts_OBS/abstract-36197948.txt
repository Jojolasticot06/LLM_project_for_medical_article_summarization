The relationship between antibodies to wild-type severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antigens and the risk of breakthrough infections is unclear, especially during circulation of the Omicron strain. We investigated the association of anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain antibody levels and the risk of subsequent breakthrough coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We included adult paramedics from an observational cohort study who received 2 mRNA vaccines but did not have COVID-19 before the blood collection. Higher postvaccination antibody levels to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 antigens were associated with a reduced risk of COVID-19. Further research into clinical utility of antibody levels, to inform a threshold for protection and timing of boosters, should be prioritized.
