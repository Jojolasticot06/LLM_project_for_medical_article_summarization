BACKGROUND: Past decades have witnessed a decrease in environmental 
biodiversity. We hypothesized a similar decrease in indigenous gut microbiota 
diversity, which may have contributed to the obesity epidemic.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in the composition and function of the gut 
microbiota in pregnant women over a period of 20 years.
STUDY DESIGN: Altogether 124 pregnant women (41 overweight and matched 83 normal 
weight) pregnant in 1997, 2007 or 2017 were included in the study. The gut 
microbiota composition was assessed from fecal samples obtained at 32 weeks of 
gestation by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Fecal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) 
profiles were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS).
RESULTS: Distinct gut microbiota profiles were detected in pregnant women from 
1997, 2007 and 2017 (PERMANOVA Bray-Curtis R2 = 0.029, p = 0.001). The women 
pregnant in 1997 exhibited significantly higher microbiota richness and 
diversity as compared to those pregnant in 2007 and 2017. The total 
concentration of fecal SCFAs was significantly higher in the pregnant women in 
1997 compared to those in 2007 and 2017. Significant differences in gut 
microbiota composition between normal weight and overweight women were manifest 
in 1997 but not in 2007 or 2017.
CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in intestinal microbiota richness and diversity over 
two decades occurred in parallel with the decline in biodiversity in our natural 
surroundings. It appears that the gut microbiota of pregnant women has changed 
over time to a composition typical for overweight individuals.
