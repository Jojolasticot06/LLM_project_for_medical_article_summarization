Several platforms for noninvasive EGFR testing are currently used in the 
clinical setting with sensitivities ranging from 30% to 100%. Prospective 
studies evaluating agreement and sources for discordant results remain lacking. 
Herein, seven methodologies including two next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based 
methods, three high-sensitivity PCR-based platforms, and two FDA-approved 
methods were compared using 72 plasma samples, from EGFR-mutant non-small-cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients progressing on a first-line tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI). NGS platforms as well as high-sensitivity PCR-based 
methodologies showed excellent agreement for EGFR-sensitizing mutations 
(K = 0.80-0.89) and substantial agreement for T790M testing (K = 0.77 and 0.68, 
respectively). Mutant allele frequencies (MAFs) obtained by different 
quantitative methods showed an excellent reproducibility (intraclass correlation 
coefficients 0.86-0.98). Among other technical factors, discordant calls mostly 
occurred at mutant allele frequencies (MAFs) ≤ 0.5%. Agreement significantly 
improved when discarding samples with MAF ≤ 0.5%. EGFR mutations were detected 
at significantly lower MAFs in patients with brain metastases, suggesting that 
these patients risk for a false-positive result. Our results support the use of 
liquid biopsies for noninvasive EGFR testing and highlight the need to 
systematically report MAFs.
