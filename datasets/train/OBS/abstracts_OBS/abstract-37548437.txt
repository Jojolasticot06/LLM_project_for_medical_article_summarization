OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of the 12-item World Health Organization 
Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS-12) in predicting institutionalization 
after subacute stroke rehabilitation.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study.
METHODS: On a specialized rehabilitation ward, discharge WHODAS-12 scores of 156 
consecutive patients (24-h National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) â‰¥ 
15) and assessment from their proxies were compared, and receiver operating 
characteristic curves for predicting institutionalization were generated. 
Clinician-rated assessments of functioning were applied for comparison.
RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the patients were unfit to respond, due to the 
consequences of major stroke. However, both patient and proxy WHODAS-12 sum 
scores differentiated the community (n = 70) and institution (n = 86) groups (p 
= 0.02 and p < 0.0001, respectively), the discriminative accuracy (area under 
the curve; AUC) being 0.63 and 0.79, respectively. In proxy assessments, the 
institutionalized patients were significantly more impaired in all item 
comparisons except for emotions and concentrating. Ability to participate 
differentiated the groups as accurately as activities (AUC 0.75 vs 0.78, 
respectively). The corresponding discriminative accuracy of the clinician-rated 
World Health Organization (WHO) minimal generic dataset sum score and modified 
Rankin Scale were 0.74 and 0.79 (p < 0.0001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Despite its brevity and subjectivity, the WHODAS-12 from proxies has 
shown high accuracy in predicting institutionalization after subacute 
rehabilitation of individuals with major stroke, the impact of participation 
being as relevant as that of activities.
