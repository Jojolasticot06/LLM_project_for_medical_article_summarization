We performed an observational study to investigate intensive care unit 
incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of coronavirus disease-associated 
pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We found 10%-15% CAPA incidence among 823 
patients in 2 cohorts. Several factors were independently associated with CAPA 
in 1 cohort and mortality rates were 43%-52%.
