1/BACKGROUND: While evidence indicates that familial predisposition influences the   risk of developing degenerative rotator cuff disease (RCD), knowledge of   specific genetic markers is limited. We conducted a genome-wide association   study of RCD surgery using the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort of 500,000   people (40 to 69 years of age at enrollment) with genotype data.  
2/METHODS: Cases with surgery for degenerative RCD were identified using linked   hospital records. The cases were defined as an International Classification of   Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code of M75.1 determined by a   trauma/orthopaedic specialist and surgery consistent with RCD treatment. Cases   were excluded if a diagnosis of traumatic injury had been made during the same   hospital visit. For each case, up to 5 controls matched by age, sex, and   follow-up time were chosen from the UK Biobank. Analyses were limited to   European-ancestry individuals who were not third-degree or closer relations. We   used logistic regression to test for genetic association of 674,405 typed and   >10 million imputed markers, after adjusting for age, sex, population principal   components, and follow-up.  
3/RESULTS: We identified 2,917 RCD surgery cases and 14,158 matched controls. We   observed 1 genome-wide significant signal (p < 5 Ã— 10-8) for a novel locus   tagged by rs2237352 in the CREB5 gene on chromosome 7 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.17,   95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.24). The single-nucleotide polymorphism   (SNP) rs2237352 was imputed with a high degree of confidence (info score =   0.9847) and is common, with a minor allele frequency of 47%. After expanding the   control sample to include additional unmatched non-cases, rs2237352 and another   SNP in the CREB5 gene, rs12700903, were genome-wide significant. We did not   detect genome-wide significant signals at loci associated with RCD in previous   studies.  
4/CONCLUSIONS: We identified a novel association between a variant in the CREB5   gene and RCD surgery. Validation of this finding in studies with imaging data to   confirm diagnoses will be an important next step.  CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Identification of genetic RCD susceptibility markers can   guide understanding of biological processes in rotator cuff degeneration and   help inform disease risk in the clinical setting.  LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level III. See Instructions for Authors for a   complete description of levels of evidence.
