1/BACKGROUND: Despite preventive measures, infections continue to pose significant risks to pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) recipients. The gut microbiota has been linked to clinical outcomes following adult allo-HCT. This study evaluated whether similar disruptions or differing microbiota patterns were associated with infection risk in pediatric allo-HCT. 
2/METHODS: In a prospective observational study, fecal samples were obtained from 74 children before conditioning and upon neutrophil recovery. Microbiome signatures identified through sequencing were examined for their associations with infections or acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in the first-year post-HCT using Cox proportional hazards analysis. 
3/RESULTS: Microbiome disruption in adults, did not predict infection risk in pediatric allo-HCT. Unique microbiota signatures were associated with different infections or aGVHD. A ratio of strict and facultative anaerobes (eg, Lachnoclostridium, Parabacteroides) prior to conditioning predicted bacteremia risk (Cox hazard ratio [HR], 3.89). A distinct ratio of oral (eg, Rothia, Veillonella) to intestinal anaerobes (eg, Anaerobutyricum, Romboutsia) at neutrophil recovery predicted likelihood of bacterial infections (Cox HR, 1.81) and viral enterocolitis (Cox HR, 1.96). 
4/CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between medical interventions, pediatric hosts, and microbial communities contribute to microbiota signatures that predict infections. Further multicenter study is necessary to validate the generalizability of these ratios as biomarkers.
