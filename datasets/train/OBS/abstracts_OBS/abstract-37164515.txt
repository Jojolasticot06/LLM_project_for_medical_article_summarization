1/BACKGROUND: Household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel use is associated with adverse birth outcomes, but data for exposure-response relationships are scarce. We examined associations between HAP exposures and birthweight in rural Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda during the Household Air Pollution Intervention Network (HAPIN) trial. 
2/METHODS: The HAPIN trial recruited pregnant women (9-<20 weeks of gestation) in rural Guatemala, India, Peru, and Rwanda and randomly allocated them to receive a liquefied petroleum gas stove or not (ie, and continue to use biomass fuel). The primary outcomes were birthweight, length-for-age, severe pneumonia, and maternal systolic blood pressure. In this exposure-response subanalysis, we measured 24-h personal exposures to PM2·5, carbon monoxide, and black carbon once pre-intervention (baseline) and twice post-intervention (at 24-28 weeks and 32-36 weeks of gestation), as well as birthweight within 24 h of birth. We examined the relationship between the average prenatal exposure and birthweight or weight-for-gestational age Z scores using multivariate-regression models, controlling for the mother's age, nulliparity, diet diversity, food insecurity, BMI, the mother's education, neonate sex, haemoglobin, second-hand smoke, and geographical indicator for randomisation strata. 
3/FINDINGS: Between March, 2018, and February, 2020, 3200 pregnant women were recruited. An interquartile increase in the average prenatal exposure to PM2·5 (74·5 μg/m3) was associated with a reduction in birthweight and gestational age Z scores (birthweight: -14·8 g [95% CI -28·7 to -0·8]; gestational age Z scores: -0·03 [-0·06 to 0·00]), as was an interquartile increase in black carbon (7·3 μg/m3; -21·9 g [-37·7 to -6·1]; -0·05 [-0·08 to -0·01]). Carbon monoxide exposure was not associated with these outcomes (1·7; -3·1 [-12·1 to 5·8]; -0·003 [-0·023 to 0·017]). 
4/INTERPRETATION: Continuing efforts are needed to reduce HAP exposure alongside other drivers of low birthweight in low-income and middle-income countries. FUNDING: US National Institutes of Health (1UM1HL134590) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (OPP1131279).
