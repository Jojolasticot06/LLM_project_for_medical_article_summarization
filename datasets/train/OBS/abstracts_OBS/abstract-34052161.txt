OBJECTIVES: The main goal of the present study was to assess hearing outcome for 
malleus removal in cholesteatoma surgery compared to a group with malleus 
conservation. The secondary aim was to compare the auditory involvement of the 
stapes between the two groups.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center observational study included adult 
patients operated on by ossiculoplasty for acquired cholesteatoma between 2015 
and 2019. Endpoints comprised improvement in pure-tone average air-bone gap 
(PTA-ABG) and air-bone gap (ABG) at conversational frequencies and, 
independently, per frequency. 136 patients were included: 95 with conserved 
malleus (M+) and 41 with malleus removal (M(). Mean time to audiometric 
follow-up was 9 months in both groups.
RESULTS: The PTA-ABG improvement was 4.4±12.6dB for the M+ group and 3.8±13.4dB 
for the M- group, with no significant significance (P=0.8). Better results (not 
exceeding 7.5dB) were found for the M+ group at 2 and 8kHz (P=0.3 and P=0.052 
respectively). Presence or absence of the stapes did not affect the results in 
either group.
CONCLUSION: Those results suggest a negligible role of the malleus in early 
hearing outcome of tympanoplasty for cholesteatoma. A slight improvement was 
observed in the M+ group at 2 and 8kHz, but its interpretation remains 
uncertain.
