BACKGROUND: The period following hospital discharge is one of significant 
vulnerability. Little is known about the relationship between post-discharge 
healthcare use and the risk of readmission.
OBJECTIVES: To explore associations between medical consultations and other 
healthcare use parameters and the risk of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission.
METHODS: Between July 2017 and March 2018, we monitored all adult internal 
medicine patients for 30 days after their discharge from four mid-sized 
hospitals. Using follow-up telephone calls, we assessed their post-discharge 
healthcare use: consultations with general practitioners (GPs) and specialist 
physicians, emergency room (ER) visits, and home visits by nurses. The binary 
outcome was defined as any unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of 
discharge, and this was analyzed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: Of 934 patients discharged, 111 (12%) experienced at least one 
unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days. Attending at least one GP 
consultation decreased the odds of readmission by half (adjusted OR: 0.5; 95%CI: 
0.3-0.7), whereas attending at least one specialist consultation doubled those 
odds (aOR: 2.0; 95%CI: 1.2-3.3). GP consultations also reduced the odds of the 
combined risk of an ER visit or unplanned hospital readmission (aOR: 0.5; 95%CI: 
0.3-0.7). ER visits were also associated with a higher readmission risk after 
adjusting for confounding factors (aOR: 10.0; 95%CI: 6.0-16.8).
CONCLUSION: GP consultations were associated with fewer ER visits and unplanned 
hospital readmissions.
