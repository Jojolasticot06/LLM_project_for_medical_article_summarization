The global burden of critical illness has steadily increased especially 
with an aging population in the developed world (1). Despite modern 
advances in life support, mortality rates in the ICU has remained persistently 
high at over 15%, and even higher for patients admitted with sepsis 
(2, 3). However, recent clinical trials have failed to identify therapies that effectively 
moderate overall ICU and sepsis-related mortality (4, 5). In large cohort 
studies, patients with diabetes contribute more than 15% of intensive care 
admissions and are at increased risks of adverse outcomes 
after intensive care (6). 

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 
have been shown to reduce the occurrence rate of 
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and adverse 
renal events among patients with type 2 diabetes 
in randomized controlled trials (7–11). At the same 
time, certain safety endpoints were more frequently 
observed in the groups assigned to SGLT2 inhibitors, 
including urinary tract infection, diabetic ketoacidosis 
(DKA), hypotension, volume depletion, and amputation 
(7–9, 12). While there have been preliminary data 
on the reduced risks of pneumonia and sepsis-related 
morbidities with use of SGLT2 inhibitors (13, 14), the 
effect on the overall burden of critical illnesses and 
their efficacy in reducing ICU-related mortality have 
not been studied. 

The objective of the study was to determine whether 
SGLT2 inhibitors had any benefit to the overall burden 
of critical illness. We hypothesized that the use of 
SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with decreased risks 
of ICU admission and all-cause mortality. We compared 
the risks and causes of admission to the ICU, 
severity of illness, and mortality associated with the 
incidental use of SGLT2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl 
peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors among patients with 
type 2 diabetes. 

METHODS 

Study Population and Design 

Data on new users of SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 
inhibitors between January 1, 2015, and December 
31, 2019, from all public hospitals in Hong Kong were 
reviewed. Patients’ baseline characteristics, clinical 
information, and outcomes were retrieved from the 
Clinical Data and Analysis Reporting System of the 
Hospital Authority in Hong Kong. We included all 
adult patients (18 yr old or older) with type 2 diabetes 
who received SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors for 
the first time or had not received these drugs within 
12 months prior to the index date. Type 2 diabetes 
was defined as having an International Classification 
of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-
CM) code starting with 250, except those indicating 
type 1 diabetes; or having baseline hemoglobin 
A1c (HbA1c) greater than or equal to 6.5%; or using 
any anti-diabetic medications (i.e., insulins, glucagonlike 
peptide-1 [GLP-1] agonists, or oral hypoglycemic 
agents). Patients who received SGLT2 inhibitors or 
DPP-4 inhibitors for other indications and did not 
have diabetes were not included. Exclusion criteria 
were patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) less than 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 or patients who 
were started on both SGLT2 inhibitors and DPP-4 
inhibitors on the index date. This study was approved 
by the Institutional Review Board of The University 
of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority of Hong Kong 
West Cluster with a waiver of informed consent on 
July 28, 2022 (Institutional Review Board reference 
number: UW 22-561, study title “Association of SGLT2 
Inhibitors and ICU Outcomes In a Territory Wide 
Longitudinal Cohort”). All procedures performed in 
this study were in accordance with the ethical standards 
of the institutional and/or national research 
committee and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 
and its later amendments. 

Definition of Exposure Variables 

We defined the index date as the first date of dispensing 
SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors. SGLT2 inhibitors 
included canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin. 
DPP-4 inhibitors included alogliptin, linagliptin, linagliptin/
metformin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin, sitagliptin/ 
metformin, vildagliptin, and vildagliptin/metformin. 

Patients were assigned to either the “SGLT2 inhibitors” 
group or “DPP-4 inhibitors” group and followed 
up according to their assigned drug group. Patients who 
were prescribed medication from the alternative drug 
group were censored on the dispense date of the alternative 
drug. 

Definition of Outcome Variables 

The co-primary outcomes were any admission to the 
ICU and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes 
were duration of ICU stay, severity of illness upon 
ICU admission, mortality due to cardiovascular, renal, 
and infectious causes, any emergent ICU admission, 
and any nonoperative ICU admission. The severity 
of illness upon ICU admission was measured by the 
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation 
(APACHE) IV-predicted mortality (15). Safety outcomes 
including DKA, lower limb amputation, new 
requirement for dialysis, acute pulmonary edema, and 
urinary tract infection were also examined. DKA was 
defined using ICD-9-CM code or an elevated betahydroxybutyrate 
level. All outcome events were recorded 
until the date of censoring or death, or the data 
cutoff date of March 31, 2022, whichever occurred 
first. Detailed ICD-9-CM codes for clinical outcomes 
are listed in eTable 1 (http://links.lww.com/CCM/ 
H330). 

Definitions of Covariables 

Patient’s baseline characteristics including age, sex, 
HbA1c, eGFR, comorbidities, and previous ICU 
admissions were collected. Detailed ICD-9-CM codes 
for comorbidities, that is, malignancy, hypertension, 
cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and 
congestive heart failure (CHF) are listed in the eTable 
1 (http://links.lww.com/CCM/H330). Concomitant 
cardiovascular medications, including aspirin, statins, 
beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors 
(ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers 
(ARBs); laboratory results were also obtained. Baseline 
laboratory results were defined as results closest to the 
index date. 

Statistical Analysis 

All analyses were performed with prespecified outcome 
and statistical methods. Based on data in published 

literature and biological plausibility, we constructed a 
logistic regression model that predicted the likelihood 
of receiving SGLT2 inhibitors or DPP-4 inhibitors. 
These included age, sex, baseline HbA1c, duration of 
diabetes, eGFR, previous ICU admission, underlying 
malignancy, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, 
coronary artery disease, CHF, use of metformin, insu-
lins, sulfonylureas, GLP-1 agonists, thiazolidinedione, 
ACEIs or ARBs, beta-blockers, statins and ezetimibe, 
calendar year of index medication initiation, risk for 
amputation, risk for fractures, and risk for genitourinary 
infections. Risk for amputation was defined using 
history of peripheral vascular disease or lower limb 
amputation. Risk for fractures was defined using history 
of osteoporosis or fractures, and risk for genitourinary 
infections was defined using history of urinary 
tract infections or positive urine cultures. The final 
study cohort consisted of two comparison groups— 
“SGLT2 inhibitors” and “DPP-4 inhibitors”—generated 
by 1:2 propensity score matching using a caliper 
of 0.2 times sd of the logit of propensity score. 

Unadjusted analyses were made using chi-square 
tests for categorical variables and Student t test or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables. 
Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to 
evaluate the relationship between use of SGLT2 inhibitors 
or DPP-4 inhibitors and clinical outcomes in a 
time-to-first-event analysis. 

Sensitivity Analyses 

First, we performed sensitivity analysis by including 
all complete cases before propensity score matching. 
A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model 
adjusting for the same variables in the propensity score 
model was used to examine the association between 
study groups and the co-primary outcomes. Next, 
we repeated the analysis in all complete cases before 
propensity score matching using inverse probability 
treatment weighting to adjust for the same set of confounders. 
An on-treatment analysis was performed to 
account for possible differences in treatment duration. 

Since the complete case method was adopted to 
address missing data in the primary statistical analysis, 
we tested the robustness of our results by repeating the 
multivariable Cox regression analysis with the entire 
cohort using the technique of multiple imputations 
by chained equations to account for missing data. We 
calculated E-values to quantify the association that a 

confounder would need to have with clinical outcomes 
to nullify the primary analyses (16). Finally, to better 
ensure that the observed association between medication 
groups and clinical outcomes was not due to 
some underlying cause unrelated to the mechanistic 
hypothesis, falsification testing was performed with 
two clinical outcomes, trauma and acute cholecystitis. 
These outcomes were selected based on unlikely causal 
relationships with the medication groups, and detailed 
ICD-9-CM codes are listed in eTable 1 (http://links. 
lww.com/CCM/H330). 

Exploratory Analysis 

Subgroup analyses were performed according to the 
following seven dichotomized subgroups: age greater 
than 65 years, sex, HbA1c greater than 8%, eGFR 
less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, previous heart failure, 
number of oral hypoglycemic agents greater than or 
equal to 2, and index medication initiation during or 
after 2018. 

All analyses were performed using Stata MP software, 
Version 16.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). A 
two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically 
significant. 

RESULTS 

Patients and Characteristics 

Between January 2015 and December 2019, a total of 
73,111 patients were considered for inclusion: 4,053 
(5.5%) were excluded after application of exclusion 
criteria. Of the remaining 69,058 patients, a total of 
6,674 (9.7%) were excluded from complete case analysis 
due to missing values in any of the variables used 
in the propensity score matching model. After 1:2 
propensity score matching, a total of 10,308 SGLT2 
inhibitors users and 17,664 DPP-4 inhibitors users 
were included in the final analysis, representing 44.8% 
of the complete case cohort (eFig. 1, http://links.lww. 
com/CCM/H330). The mean age of the cohort was 
59 ± 11 years, and 17,416 (62.3%) were male. Baseline 
characteristics and medications prescribed of the propensity 
score matched cohort and the complete case 
cohort are shown in Table 1 and eTable 2 (http://links. 
lww.com/CCM/H330), respectively. All variables in 
Table 1 were included in the propensity score model, 
and apart from certain oral anti-diabetic agents were 

well-balanced between groups with standardized difference 
less than 0.1. The median follow-up period was 

2.9 years (2.3–4.0 yr). 
ICU Admission 

Table 2 describes the primary and secondary outcomes 
in SGLT2 inhibitors users and DPP-4 inhibitors 
users. Critical illness requiring ICU admission 
occurred in 286 patients (2.8%) in the SGLT2 inhibitor 
group and 645 patients (3.7%) in the DPP-4 inhibitor 
group. The risk of ICU admission was lower in SGLT2 
inhibitors users compared with DPP-4 inhibitors 
users (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69–0.91; p = 
0.001), translating to an absolute between-group difference 
of 0.9 percentage points (95% CI, 0.5–1.3) and 
a number needed to treat of 114. The severity of illness 
upon ICU admission was lower in SGLT2 inhibitors 
users compared with DPP-4 inhibitors users (median 
APACHE IV-predicted risk of death 0.08 [0.03–0.25] 
vs 0.14 [0.05–0.36]; p < 0.001). The ICU length of stay 
was similar between the two groups. The risk of emergency 
ICU admission was lower in SGLT2 inhibitors 
users (208 [2.0%] vs 496 [2.8%]; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 
0.64–0.89; p = 0.001), as was the risk of nonoperative 
ICU admission (151 [1.5%] vs 415 [2.4%]; HR, 0.66; 
95% CI, 0.54–0.79; p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves showed that the use of SGLT2 inhibitors was 
associated with lower risks of critical illness requiring 
any ICU admission, emergent ICU admission, and 
nonoperative ICU admission (Fig. 1). Admissions for 
sepsis were fewer in SGLT2 inhibitors users compared 
with DPP-4 inhibitors users (45 [0.4%] vs 134 [0.8%]; 
HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43–0.85; p = 0.004). Data for other 
causes of ICU admission are presented in eTable 3 
(http://links.lww.com/CCM/H330). 

All-Cause Mortality 

The co-primary outcome of all-cause mortality 
occurred in 315 patients (3.1%) in the SGLT2 inhibitor 
group and 1,327 patients (7.5%) in the 
DPP-4 inhibitor group. The risk of death was lower 
in SGLT2 inhibitors users compared with DPP-4 
inhibitors users (HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.38–0.49; p < 
0.001), translating to an absolute between-group 
difference of 4.5 percentage points (95% CI, 3.9– 

5.0) and a number needed to treat of 22 (Table 2). 
The risk of mortality due to infectious causes was

DPP-4 inhibitors users (59 [0.6%] vs 414 [2.3%]; 
HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.20–0.34; p < 0.001). The risk 
of cardiovascular death was lower in SGLT2 inhibitors

These associations remained significant after

as determined by the propensity score (ICU admission:

in the two medication groups (SGLT2 inhibitors: 
953 d [403–1,367 d] and DPP-4 inhibitors: 967 d 
[400–1,351 d]; p = 0.70), and results in the on-treatment 
analysis were similar to the intention-to-treat 
analysis. 

A total of two variables, baseline HbA1c and eGFR, in 
the propensity score model had missing data. Multiple 
imputation was conducted, and the imputed cohort included 
all 6,674 patients (9.7%) who were excluded due to 
missing values in any of the variables used in the propensity

be very strongly associated with ICU admission and allcause 
mortality (> 60% difference in prevalence between 
SGLT2 inhibitors users and DPP-4 inhibitors users, and a 
HR > 1.6 or < 0.6 on ICU admission). Finally, falsification 
testing showed that the clinical outcomes of trauma and 
acute cholecystitis were not significantly associated with 
medication group. Detailed results of sensitivity analyses 
are presented in Table 2. 

Subgroup Analyses 

The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on the outcomes of 
ICU admission and all-cause mortality was modified 

by eGFR (p for interaction < 0.001 and 0.004, respectively), 
with patients with eGFR less than 60 mL/ 
min/1.73 m2 deriving more clinical benefit than those 
with eGFR greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 
m2. The benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on ICU admission 
was greater in patients on less than two oral hypoglycemic 
agents (p for interaction = 0.042) and 
the benefit of SGLT2 inhibitors on all-cause mortality 
was greater in patients who were initiated on 
index medication before 2018 (p for interaction = 
0.025). The associations between SGLT2 inhibitors 
and outcomes were not modified by age, sex, HbA1c 
level, or previous CHF (p for interaction > 0.05 for

and Fig. 3). 

Safety Outcomes 

Safety outcomes are reported in Table 3. The risks of lower 
limb amputation, new requirement for dialysis, acute pulmonary 
edema, and urinary tract infection were significantly 
lower in SGLT2 inhibitors users compared with 
DPP-4 inhibitors users (p < 0.05 for all). The risk of DKA 
was similar between the SGLT2 inhibitor users and DPP-4 
inhibitor users (160 [1.6%] vs 297 [1.7%]; p = 0.41). 

DISCUSSION 

In this cohort of 69,058 adult patients with type 2 diabetes, 
initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors compared with 
DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with lower risks of 
critical illness, decreased disease severity, and lower 
all-cause mortality over a median follow-up of 2.9 
years. We identified that infections- and sepsis-related 
admissions to ICU and mortality were concurrently 
mitigated by the use of SGLT2 inhibitors. The beneficial 
effects of SGLT2 inhibitors were seen across various 
subgroups of age and underlying comorbid conditions, 

Figure 3. Forest plots for subgroups analyses. The effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) on the outcomes 
of ICU admission and all-cause mortality was modified by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p for interaction < 0.001 and 
0.004, respectively). Patients who were on less than two oral hypoglycemic agents and patients who were initiated on index medication 
before 2018 also derived greater clinical benefit. There was no effect modification in other predefined subgroups for the two co-primary 
outcomes—critical illness requiring any ICU admission (A) and all-cause mortality (B). DDP4i = dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, HbA1c = 
hemoglobin A1c. 

and the protection appeared to be more pronounced in 
patients with chronic renal impairment. 

SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to effectively reduce 
MACE and renal events among patients with type 
2 diabetes (7–10). Since hospitalizations secondary to

are clearly reduced with the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, 
it would be reasonable to extrapolate a reduction 
in burden of critical illnesses and admissions to ICU. 
However, SGLT2 inhibitors have been associated with 
a two- to 10-fold risk of DKA (8, 17), along with other 
safety concerns including a doubling in risk of severe 
urinary tract infection (18), hospital admission for 
infections (19), volume depletion (8, 20), hypotension 
(21), or even amputation (9). Taken together, the net 
effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on critical illness and the 
utilization of ICU resources remains to be clarified. To 
our knowledge, this topic has never been evaluated in 
any randomized trials or observational studies. 

In the current study including a large representative 
cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes, we observed 
that the risk of critical illness requiring admission to 

ICU was reduced by approximately 20% with the use 
of SGLT2 inhibitors. The biological mechanisms underlying 
the protective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors 
against critical illnesses are multidimensional, among 
which benefits in cardiac and renal function are two of 
the most important. SGLT2 inhibitors can improve cell 
life programming (22), arterial stiffness (23), cardiac 
structure and function (24, 25), and reduce cardiorenal 
effects and albuminuria (26, 27); hence, the strong 
cardiorenal efficacy observed in clinical trials (28). In 
our cohort, the absolute differences in mortality due to 
cardiovascular and renal causes were 0.9% and 0.1%, 
respectively. 

More specific to acute and critical illnesses, SGLT2 
inhibitors have been associated with protective effects 
against pneumonia, sepsis, and infection-related mortality 
(13). This may be related to the anti-inflammatory 
properties of SGLT2 inhibitors, mediated 
through down-regulation of cytokine production by 
macrophages and inflammasomes (29). Alternative 
mechanisms such as counteracting lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS)-induced vascular hyperpermeability and

improving intestinal barrier function have also been 
demonstrated in animal models (30, 31). The beneficial 
effects of SGLT2 inhibitors were observed across 
all categories of ICU admission but were most evident 
in reducing nonoperative ICU admissions, which in 
our cohort referred to emergency admissions due to 
nonsurgical causes. When further stratified by disease 
category, the reduction in ICU admission due to sepsis 
was the most striking, with a 40% reduction in risk 
for SGLT2 inhibitors users. The milder severity of illness 
upon ICU admission may be partially explained 
by pathophysiological mechanisms such as damping 
of LPS-induced acute renal injury in animal models 
(14), possibly undermining the greater benefit derived 
in patients with renal impairment and eGFR less than 
60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The reduction of sepsis-related 
complications in chronic users of SGLT2 inhibitors, if 
confirmed in follow-up prospective trials, could have 
significant implications for the population with diabetes, 
to whom up to 6% of infection-related hospitalizations 
and 12% of infection-related deaths had been 
attributed (32). It remains to be examined whether 
users of SGLT2 inhibitors for reasons other than diabetes 
would derive similar clinical benefits. 

The significant reduction in all-cause mortality of 
SGLT2 inhibitors that has been demonstrated in randomized 
trials was further validated in our cohort (9, 
11), as were reductions in death due to cardiovascular, 
renal, and infection-related causes, with a number 
needed to treat of 22. Recent studies have shown that 
the clinical benefit derived from SGLT2 inhibitors 
begins to manifest as early as 13 days (33). The potential 
cost-efficiency of SGLT2 inhibitors in decreasing 

healthcare utilization and morbidities across broad 
populations of patients with cardiovascular risk factors, 
risks for progressive renal injury, and even immunosuppressed 
or infection-prone individuals could 
amount to significant cost-benefit ratios across hospital 
intensive care systems (34). 

The current study had some limitations. First, the 
observational nature of the study conferred risks of 
unmeasured confounding and bias, but the large cohort 
size with complete longitudinal electronic healthcare 
records and incident new user design minimized 
selection, information, and recall biases (35). We used 
rigorous propensity score matching, and the findings 
were consistent in many sensitivity analyses. The utilization 
of an active comparator of DPP-4 inhibitors 
allowed evaluation of SGLT2 inhibitors in a typical decision 
bifurcation during escalation of diabetes care. 
Second, we only collected prescription data and could 
not ascertain drug adherence, which could have biased 
the results toward the null. Third, patients were 
censored if they crossed over to or added on the other 
drug class, and the effect of continuing both drug 
classes is unclear. 

CONCLUSIONS 

In conclusion, we showed that patients with type 2 
diabetes who were on SGLT2 inhibitors were independently 
associated with reduction in admission to 
the ICU, milder disease severity, and lower all-cause 
mortality compared with patients on DPP-4 inhibitors. 
The use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the critical care setting 
remains to be clarified in future prospective trials.
