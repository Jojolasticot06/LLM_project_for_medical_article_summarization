1/BACKGROUND: Due to the special anatomy of the lower leg, tibial diaphyseal fracture causes increased intracompartmental pressure (ICP). Not only is this increased ICP the manifestation of skeletal muscle injury, but it induces further deterioration of the injury. The aim of this study was to assess the association between short-term ICP elevation and long-term skeletal muscle recovery after severe limb trauma. 
2/METHODS: In this single-center ambispective cohort study, we retrospectively screened and recruited a cohort of tibial diaphyseal fracture patients with integrated ICP data during the early post-traumatic period, and performed a prospective observational study to evaluate their skeletal muscle recovery through long-term follow-up and MR imaging after the removal of the implants. We analyzed the association between ICP elevation and skeletal muscle recovery using statistical methods. 
3/RESULTS: A total of 46 patients with healed fractures underwent intramedullary nail removal and MR imaging. The absolute values of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients between various ICP parameters and the cross-sectional area ratio (CSAR) ranged from 0.588 to 0.793, and the correlation coefficients between the ICP parameters and the average T2-weighted signal intensity ratio (T2SIR) varied from 0.566 to 0.775. Statistically significant associations were observed between the ICP parameters and the MR imaging parameters when simple linear regression analysis was performed. Among the ICP parameters, the accumulated ΔP (ΔP = diastolic blood pressure minus ICP) had the highest determination coefficient and explained 62.1% and 59.1% of the variance in CSAR and T2SIR, respectively. 
4/CONCLUSIONS: Short-term ICP elevation was associated with long-term skeletal muscle recovery following tibial diaphyseal fracture, especially for ICP data that integrated time factors. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 3.
