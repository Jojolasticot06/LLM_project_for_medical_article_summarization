An effective and chemotherapy-free strategy of all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide for acute promyelocytic leukemia in all risk groups (APL15 trial).

1/The combination of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been demonstrated to have comparable effectiveness or better to ATRA and chemotherapy (CHT) in non-high-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, the efficacy of ATRA-ATO compared to ATRA-ATO plus CHT in high-risk APL remains unknown. 
2/Here we performed a randomized multi-center non-inferiority phase III study to compare the efficacy of ATRA-ATO and ATRA-ATO plus CHT in newly diagnosed all-risk APL to address this question. Patients were assigned to receive ATRA-ATO for induction, consolidation, and maintenance or ATRA-ATO plus CHT for induction followed by three cycles of consolidation therapy, and maintenance therapy with ATRA-ATO. In the non-CHT group, hydroxyurea was used to control leukocytosis. 
3/ A total of 128 patients were treated. The complete remission rate was 97% in both groups.The 2-year disease-free, event-free survival rates in the non-CHT group and CHT group in all-risk patients were 98% vs 97%, and 95% vs 92%, respectively (P = 0.62 and P = 0.39, respectively). And they were 94% vs 87%, and 85% vs 78% in the high-risk patients (P = 0.52 and P = 0.44, respectively). 
4/This study demonstrated that ATRA-ATO had the same efficacy as the ATRA-ATO plus CHT in the treatment of patients with all-risk APL.
