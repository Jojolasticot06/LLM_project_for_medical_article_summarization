OBJECTIVES: Studies have suggested intrapulmonary shunts may contribute to 
hypoxemia in COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with worse 
associated outcomes. We evaluated the presence of right-to-left (R-L) shunts in 
COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS patients using a comprehensive hypoxemia workup for 
shunt etiology and associations with mortality.
DESIGN: Prospective, observational cohort study.
SETTING: Four tertiary hospitals in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.
PATIENTS: Adult critically ill, mechanically ventilated, ICU patients admitted 
with COVID-19 or non-COVID (November 16, 2020, to September 1, 2021).
INTERVENTIONS: Agitated-saline bubble studies with transthoracic 
echocardiography/transcranial Doppler Â± transesophageal echocardiography 
assessed for R-L shunts presence.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were shunt frequency and 
association with hospital mortality. Logistic regression analysis was used for 
adjustment. The study enrolled 226 patients (182 COVID-19 vs 42 non-COVID). 
Median age was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR], 47-67 yr) and Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores of 30 (IQR, 21-36). In 
COVID-19 patients, the frequency of R-L shunt was 31 of 182 COVID patients 
(17.0%) versus 10 of 44 non-COVID patients (22.7%), with no difference detected 
in shunt rates (risk difference [RD], -5.7%; 95% CI, -18.4 to 7.0; p = 0.38). In 
the COVID-19 group, hospital mortality was higher for those with R-L shunt 
compared with those without (54.8% vs 35.8%; RD, 19.0%; 95% CI, 0.1-37.9; p = 
0.05). This did not persist at 90-day mortality nor after adjustment with 
regression.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of increased R-L shunt rates in COVID-19 
compared with non-COVID controls. R-L shunt was associated with increased 
in-hospital mortality for COVID-19 patients, but this did not persist at 90-day 
mortality or after adjusting using logistic regression.
