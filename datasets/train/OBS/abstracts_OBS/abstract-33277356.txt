OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the quality improvement measures made by 
Norwegian general practice (GP) during the COVID-19 pandemic, evaluate the 
differences in quality improvements based on region and assess the combinations 
of actions taken.
DESIGN: Descriptive study.
SETTING: Participants were included after taking part in an online quality 
improvement COVID-19 course for Norwegian GPs in April 2020. The participants 
reported whether internal and external measures were in place: COVID-19 sign on 
entrance, updated home page, access to video consultations and/or electronic 
written consultations, home office solutions, separate working teams, 
preparedness for home visits, isolation rooms, knowledge on decontamination, 
access to sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and 
COVID-19 clinics.
PARTICIPANTS: One hundred GP offices were included. The mean number of general 
practitioners per office was 5.63.
RESULTS: More than 80% of practices had the following preparedness measures: 
COVID-19 sign on entrance, updated home page, COVID-19 clinic in the 
municipality, video and written electronic consultations, knowledge on how to 
use PPE, and home office solutions for general practitioners. Less than 50% had 
both PPE and knowledge of decontamination. Lack of PPE was reported by 37%, and 
34% reported neither sufficient PPE nor a dedicated COVID-19 clinic. 15% 
reported that they had an isolation room, but not enough PPE. There were no 
geographical differences.
CONCLUSIONS: Norwegian GPs in this study implemented many quality improvements 
to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, the largest potentials for 
improvement seem to be securing sufficient supply of PPE and establishing an 
isolation room at their practices.
