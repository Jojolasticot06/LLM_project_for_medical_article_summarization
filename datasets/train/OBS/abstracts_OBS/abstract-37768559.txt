BackgroundMultidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria are among chief causes of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). In Spain, studies addressing multidrug resistance based on epidemiological surveillance systems are lacking.AimIn this observational study, cases of HAIs by MDR bacteria notified to the epidemiological surveillance system of Andalusia, Spain, between 2014-2021, were investigated. Notified cases and their spatiotemporal distribution were described, with a focus on social determinants of health (SDoH).MethodsNew cases during the study period of HAIs caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-/carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, MDR Acinectobacter baumannii, MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa or meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus were considered. Among others, notification variables included sex and age, while socio-economic variables comprised several SDoH. Cases' spatial distribution across municipalities was assessed. The smooth standardised incidence ratio (sSIR) was obtained using a Bayesian spatial model. Association between municipalities' sSIR level and SDoH was evaluated by bivariate analysis.ResultsIn total, 6,389 cases with a median age of 68 years were notified; 61.4% were men (n = 3,921). The most frequent MDR bacteria were ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (2,812/6,389; 44.0%); the main agent was Klebsiella spp. (2,956/6,389; 46.3%). Between 2014 and 2021 case numbers appeared to increase. Overall, up to 15-fold differences in sSIR between municipalities were observed. In bivariate analysis, there appeared to be an association between municipalities' sSIR level and deprivation (p = 0.003).ConclusionThis study indicates that social factors should be considered when investigating HAIs by MDR bacteria. The case incidence heterogeneity between Andalusian municipalities might be explained by SDoH, but also possibly by under-notification. Automatising reporting may address the latter.
