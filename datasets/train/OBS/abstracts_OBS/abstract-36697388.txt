Systemic light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a rare and debilitating disease. 
Advances have been made in new treatments in recent years, yet real-world data 
on the management of the disease are scarce. EMN23 is a retrospective, 
observational study of patients who initiated first-line treatment in 2004-2018 
in Europe, presenting the demographics, clinical characteristics, treatment 
patterns, and outcomes, from 4480 patients. Regimens based on bortezomib were 
the most frequently used as first-line therapy; only 6.2% of the patients 
received autologous stem cell transplant. Hematologic responses improved 
post-2010 (67.1% vs 55.6% pre-2010). The median overall survival (OS) was 48.8 
(45.2-51.7) months; 51.4 (47.3-57.7) months pre-2010 and 46.7 (41.3-52.2) months 
post-2010. Early mortality was 13.4% and did not improve (11.4% vs 14.4% pre- 
and post-2010); furthermore, it remained high in patients with advanced cardiac 
disease (over 39% for stage IIIb). There was a significant improvement for stage 
IIIa (14.2 vs 30.7 months, p = 0.0170) but no improvement for stage IIIb 
patients (5.0 vs 4.5 months). This European real-world study of AL-amyloidosis 
emphasizes the unmet needs of early diagnosis, and the lack of improvement in 
survival outcomes of the frail stage IIIb population, despite the introduction 
of new therapies in recent years.
