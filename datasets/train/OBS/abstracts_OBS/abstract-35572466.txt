Transplantation of kidneys from shorter donors into taller recipients may lead to suboptimal allograft survival. The effect of discrepancy in donor and recipient heights (ΔHeight) on long term transplant outcomes is not known. Adult patients ≥18 years undergoing living or deceased donor (LD or DD) kidney transplants alone from donors ≥18 years between 2000 and 2016 in the United States were included in this observational study. The cohort was divided into three groups based on ΔHeight of 5 inches as 1) Recipient < Donor (DD: 31,688, LD: 12,384), 2) Recipient = Donor (DD: 84,711, LD: 54,709), and 3) Recipient > Donor (DD: 21,741, LD: 18,753). Univariate analysis showed a higher risk of DCGL and mortality in both DD and LD (p < 0.001 for both). The absolute difference in graft and patient survival between the two extremes of ΔHeight was 5.7% and 5.7% for DD, and 0.4% and 1.4% for LD. On multivariate analysis, the HR of DCGL for Recipient < Donor and Recipient > Donor was 0.95 (p = 0.05) and 1.07 (p = 0.01) in DD and 0.98 (p = 0.55) and 1.14 (p < 0.001) in LD. Similarly, the corresponding HR of mortality were 0.97 (p = 0.07) and 1.07 (p = 0.003) for DD and 1.01 (p < 0.001) and 1.05 (p = 0.13) for LD. For DGF, the HR were 1.04 (p = 0.1) and 1.01 (p = 0.7) for DD and 1.07 (p = 0.45) and 0.89 (p = 0.13) for LD. Height mismatch between the donor and recipient influences kidney transplant outcomes.
