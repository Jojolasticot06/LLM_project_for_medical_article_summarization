On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. This has led to the rapid development and emergency approval of vaccines to overcome the alarming spread of the virus. Data on the cutaneous side effects related to the COVID-19 vaccine remains limited. In this prospective observational study, which was conducted from June 20 to September 20, 2021, we evaluated the incidence and various patterns of cutaneous side effects reported post COVID-19 vaccination in Al Buraimi Governorate in Oman. All vaccinated individuals aged 12 years and older, who had a skin reaction within 4 weeks following any dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, were enrolled in the study. The demographic data, medical history, vaccine-related information of all the patients were documented and the analysis was performed using the SPSS version 23 software. In total, 67 cutaneous reactions were reported by 55 patients accounting for 0.11% of all vaccinated individuals. The mean age of the patients was 33.3 years, 80.6% were females, 61.2% of the reactions were reported after the first vaccine dose, and 38.8% were reported after the second dose. We observed a wide range of cutaneous reactions and categorized them into three major patterns: local injection site reaction (2%), new onset rash (81.6%), and flare up of pre-existing dermatological conditions (16.4%). Notably, urticaria was the most common reaction overall, followed by generalized pruritus and maculopapular rash. In general, we reported a diversity of cutaneous side effects that healthcare workers should be aware of as some reactions may be overlooked and not linked to the COVID-19 vaccination.
