OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the first three waves of COVID-19 on the 
academic and surgical training of ENT and Head and Neck Surgery residents in 
France.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational, retrospective study. A 55-item survey of 
academic education and surgical training was sent to ENT residents in five major 
French regions (Île-de-France, Rhône-Alpes Auvergne, Occitanie, Grand Est, Grand 
Ouest) from August to October 2021.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine out of 135 residents (66%) responded. Two-thirds considered 
that surgical training was more affected than academic education, with 
reductions evaluated of 50-75%, 25-50% and 0-25% for the first three waves, 
respectively. Residents in Île-de-France, Rhône-Alpes Auvergne and Grand Est 
were the most affected by the first wave (75-100% reduction in surgical 
activity, in parallel to increased admissions). Otology, rhinology and 
functional exploration were the most affected, whereas pediatrics and oncology 
were spared. Seventy-one of the 89 residents (79.7%) felt that the first wave 
impacted their career, while this proportion decreased to 39.3% and 44.9% for 
the second and third waves, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The first wave of COVID-19, compared to the following two waves, 
severely impacted the surgical training of French ENT residents, especially in 
regions severely impacted by the pandemic, while academic education was 
relatively safeguarded by the implementation of e-learning alternatives.
