PURPOSE: Although the prevalence of community-acquired respiratory bacterial 
coinfection upon hospital admission in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) has been reported to be < 5%, almost three-quarters of patients 
received antibiotics. We aim to investigate whether procalcitonin (PCT) or 
C-reactive protein (CRP) upon admission could be helpful biomarkers to identify 
bacterial coinfection among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.
METHODS: We carried out a multicentre, observational cohort study including 
consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to 55 Spanish intensive care units 
(ICUs). The primary outcome was to explore whether PCT or CRP serum levels upon 
hospital admission could predict bacterial coinfection among patients with 
COVID-19 pneumonia. The secondary outcome was the evaluation of their 
association with mortality. We also conducted subgroups analyses in higher risk 
profile populations.
RESULTS: Between 5 February 2020 and 21 December 2021, 4076 patients were 
included, 133 (3%) of whom presented bacterial coinfection. PCT and CRP had low 
area under curve (AUC) scores at the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve analysis [0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51-0.61) and 0.6 (95% CI, 
0.55-0.64), respectively], but high negative predictive values (NPV) [97.5% (95% 
CI 96.5-98.5) and 98.2% (95% CI 97.5-98.9) for PCT and CRP, respectively]. CRP 
alone was associated with bacterial coinfection (OR 2, 95% CI 1.25-3.19; 
p = 0.004). The overall 15, 30 and 90 days mortality had a higher trend in the 
bacterial coinfection group, but without significant difference. 
PCT ≥ 0.12 ng/mL was associated with higher 90 days mortality.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that measurements of PCT and CRP, alone and at a 
single time point, are not useful for ruling in or out bacterial coinfection in 
viral pneumonia by COVID-19.
