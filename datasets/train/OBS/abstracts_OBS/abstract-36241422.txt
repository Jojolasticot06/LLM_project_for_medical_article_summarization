We enrolled 136 patients with laboratory-confirmed monkeypox during June 
4-August 31, 2022, at the University Hospital Institute Méditerranée Infection 
in Marseille, France. The median patient age was 36 years (interquartile range 
31-42 years). Of 136 patients, 125 (92%) were men who have sex with men, 15 
(11%) reported previous smallpox vaccinations, and 21 (15.5%) were HIV-positive. 
The most frequent lesion locations were the genitals (68 patients, 53%), 
perianal region (65 patients, 49%), and oral/perioral area (22 patients, 17%). 
Lesion locations largely corresponded with the route of contamination. Most 
(68%) patients had isolated anal, genital, or oral lesions when they were first 
seen, including 56 (61%) who had >1 positive site without a visible lesion. 
Concurrent sexually transmitted infections were diagnosed in 19 (15%) patients, 
and 7 patients (5%) were asymptomatic. We recommend vaccination campaigns, 
intensified testing for sexually transmitted infections, and increased contact 
tracing to control the ongoing monkeypox outbreak.
