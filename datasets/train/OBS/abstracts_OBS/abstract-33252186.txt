Low steady-state levels of active tamoxifen metabolites have been associated 
with inferior treatment outcomes. In this retrospective analysis of 406 estrogen 
receptor-positive breast cancer (BC) patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen as 
initial treatment, we have associated our previously reported thresholds for the 
two active metabolites, Z-endoxifen and Z-4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (Z-4OHtam), with 
treatment outcomes in an independent cohort of BC patients. Among all patients, 
metabolite levels did not affect survival. However, in the premenopausal 
subgroup receiving tamoxifen alone (n = 191) we confirmed an inferior BC 
-specific survival in patients with the previously described serum concentration 
threshold of Z-4OHtam ≤ 3.26 nm (HR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.02-5.48, P = 0.039). The 
'dose-response' survival trend in patients categorized to ordinal concentration 
cut-points of Z-4OHtamoxifen (≤ 3.26, 3.27-8.13, > 8.13 nm) was also replicated 
(P-trend log-rank = 0.048). Z-endoxifen was not associated with outcome. This is 
the first study to confirm the association between a published active tamoxifen 
metabolite threshold and BC outcome in an independent patient cohort. 
Premenopausal patients receiving 5-year of tamoxifen alone may benefit from 
therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure tamoxifen effectiveness.
