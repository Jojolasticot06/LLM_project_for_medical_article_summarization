1/BACKGROUND: Disability in activities of daily living (ADL) significantly increases the risk of mortality among patients undergoing hemodialysis. Malnutrition and decreased exercise capacity are closely correlated with ADL disability. Phase angle (PhA) has been proposed as a measure of nutritional status and exercise capacity. This study aims to investigate the prevalence of ADL disability in hemodialysis patients and its association with PhA. 2/METHODS: A prospective, observational study was conducted, involving hemodialysis patients treated between November 2019 and January 2020 in an affiliated hospital of Chinese university. ADL was measured using both basic ADL (BADL) scales and instrumental ADL (IADL) scales. PhA measurements were obtained using a BIA device while the patients were in the supine position after dialysis. 
3/RESULTS: A total of 237 hemodialysis patients with a mean age of 60.01 ± 13.55 years were included in this study. The prevalence of disability in ADL was 43.5%. Multivariable analysis results showed a robust association between low PhA and disability in both BADL and IADL (for each unit decrease in PhA: odds ratio 4.83 [95% CI: 2.56-9.0], and 3.57 [95% CI: 2.14-5.95], respectively). The optimal cut-off values of PhA for disability in BADL and IADL were 4.8 and 5.4, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were 0.783 (0.727, 0.835) and 0.799 (0.743, 0.848), respectively. 
4/CONCLUSIONS: Low PhA is strongly associated with disability in ADL in hemodialysis patients. These findings suggest that PhA may serve as a potentially objective measure of ADL disability in hemodialysis patients. rests.
