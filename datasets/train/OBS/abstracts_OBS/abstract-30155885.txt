1/BACKGROUND: Biologic therapies have revolutionized the treatment of  moderate-to-severe psoriasis. However, for reasons largely unknown, many  patients do not respond or lose response to these drugs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate demographic, social and clinical factors that could be  used to predict effectiveness and stratify response to biologic therapies in  psoriasis. 
2/METHODS: Using a multicentre, observational, prospective pharmacovigilance study  (BADBIR), we identified biologic-naive patients starting biologics with outcome  data at 6 (n = 3079) and 12 (n = 3110) months. Associations between 31 putative  predictors and outcomes were investigated in univariate and multivariable  regression analyses. Potential stratifiers of treatment response were  investigated with statistical interactions. 
3/RESULTS: Eight factors associated with reduced odds of achieving ≥ 90%  improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 90) at 6 months were  identified (described as odds ratio and 95% confidence interval): demographic  (female sex, 0·78, 0·66-0·93); social (unemployment, 0·67, 0·45-0·99);  unemployment due to ill health (0·62, 0·48-0·82); ex- and current smoking (0·81,  0·66-0·99 and 0·79, 0·63-0·99, respectively); clinical factors (high weight,  0·99, 0·99-0·99); psoriasis of the palms and/or soles (0·75, 0·61-0·91); and  presence of small plaques only compared with small and large plaques (0·78,  0·62-0·96). White ethnicity (1·48, 1·12-1·97) and higher baseline PASI (1·04,  1·03-1·04) were associated with increased odds of achieving PASI 90. The  findings were largely consistent at 12 months. There was little evidence for  predictors of differential treatment response. 
4/CONCLUSIONS: Psoriasis phenotype and potentially modifiable factors are  associated with poor outcomes with biologics, underscoring the need for  lifestyle management. Effect sizes suggest that these factors alone cannot  inform treatment selection.
