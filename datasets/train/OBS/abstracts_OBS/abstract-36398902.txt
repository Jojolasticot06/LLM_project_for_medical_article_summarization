Mounting evidence points towards a pivotal role of gut microbiota in multiple 
sclerosis (MS) pathophysiology. Yet, whether disease-modifying treatments alter 
microbiota composition and whether microbiota shape treatment response and 
side-effects remain unclear. In this prospective observational pilot study, we 
assessed the effect of dimethyl fumarate (DMF) on gut microbiota and on 
host/microbial metabolomics in a cohort of 20Â MS patients. Combining 
state-of-the-art microbial sequencing, metabolome mass spectrometry, and 
computational analysis, we identified longitudinal changes in gut microbiota 
composition under DMF-treatment and an increase in citric acid cycle 
metabolites. Notably, DMF-induced lymphopenia, a clinically relevant safety 
concern, was correlated with distinct baseline microbiome signatures in MS 
patients. We identified gastrointestinal microbiota as a key therapeutic target 
for metabolic properties of DMF. By characterizing gut microbial composition as 
a candidate risk factor for DMF-induced lymphopenia, we provide novel insights 
into the role of microbiota in mediating clinical side-effects.
