OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of single and accumulated geriatric 
deficits with HRQOL decline in patients after treatment for HNC.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between October 2014 and May 2016, patients 
at a tertiary referral center were included in the Oncological Life Study 
(OncoLifeS), a prospective data biobank, and followed up for 2 years. A 
consecutive series of 369 patients with HNC underwent geriatric assessment at 
baseline; a cohort of 283 patients remained eligible for analysis, and after 2 
years, 189 patients remained in the study. Analysis was performed between March 
and November 2020.
INTERVENTIONS OR EXPOSURES: Geriatric assessment included scoring of the Adult 
Comorbidity Evaluation 27, polypharmacy, Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool, 
Activities of Daily Living, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), 
Timed Up & Go, Mini-Mental State Examination, 15-item Geriatric Depression 
Scale, marital status, and living situation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the Global Health 
Status/Quality of Life (GHS/QOL) scale of the European Organisation for Research 
and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30. Differences 
between patients were evaluated using linear mixed models at 3 months after 
treatment (main effects, β [95% CI]) and declining course per year during 
follow-up (interaction × time, β [95% CI]), adjusted for baseline GHS/QOL 
scores, and age, sex, stage, and treatment modality.
RESULTS: Among the 283 patients eligible for analysis, the mean (SD) age was 
68.3 (10.9) years, and 193 (68.2%) were male. Severe comorbidity (β = -7.00 
[-12.43 to 1.56]), risk of malnutrition (β = -6.18 [-11.55 to -0.81]), and IADL 
restrictions (β = -10.48 [-16.39 to -4.57]) were associated with increased 
GHS/QOL decline at 3 months after treatment. Severe comorbidity (β = -4.90 
[-9.70 to -0.10]), IADL restrictions (β = -5.36 [-10.50 to -0.22]), restricted 
mobility (β = -6.78 [-12.81 to -0.75]), signs of depression (β = -7.08 [-13.10 
to -1.06]), and living with assistance or in a nursing home (β = -8.74 [-15.75 
to -1.73]) were associated with further GHS/QOL decline during follow-up. 
Accumulation of domains with geriatric deficits was a major significant factor 
for GHS/QOL decline at 3 months after treatment (per deficient domain β = -3.17 
[-5.04 to -1.30]) and deterioration during follow-up (per domain per year 
β = -2.74 [-4.28 to -1.20]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this prospective cohort study, geriatric deficits 
were significantly associated with HRQOL decline after treatment for HNC. 
Therefore, geriatric assessment may aid decision-making, indicate interventions, 
and reduce loss of HRQOL.
