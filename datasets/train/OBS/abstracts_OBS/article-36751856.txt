Introduction

Celiac disease (CD) is a complex autoimmune disease 
occurring in ~1% of the population worldwide.1 
Gluten ingestion triggers an autoimmune reaction 
leading to duodenal damage characterized by villous 
atrophy and resulting malabsorption.2 CD diagnosis 
in adults is based on the positivity of serum tissue- 
transglutaminase 2 (TG) IgA antibodies, confirmed 
by histopathological analyses of duodenal biopsy.3,4 
However, this diagnostic approach presents some 
limitations, such as the low capacity to accurately 
test CD in seronegative subjects or the fact that 
villous atrophy can also be due to medical treatments 
or other enteropathies besides CD.5 So far, the only treatment for CD is to adhere to a lifelong 
gluten-free diet (GFD), although its long-term 
effects have not been thoroughly investigated. 
Thus, novel biomarkers for CD diagnosis and monitoring 
of the GFD adherence/effects could be helpful 
in the management of this disease.6

The immune system dysregulation or the GFD- 
imposed dietary regime could lead to transcriptional/
post-transcriptional alterations potentially 
involving small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), key 
cellular regulators of gene expression.7 microRNAs 
(miRNAs) are ~22-nt-long molecules targeting 
genes involved in pivotal cellular processes and diseases, 
including those of the gastrointestinal tract.8,9 
Although they are the most studied class of 
sncRNAs, few studies have characterized miRNA 
expression in CD, performing the analyses in intestinal 
epithelium and blood only.10–12

Accumulating evidence associated specific nutrient 
intake with miRNA expression.13,14 In particular, 
our group previously reported that fecal miRNA 
profiles change with anthropometric traits and lifestyle 
habits15 as well as accurately distinguish subjects 
with different dietary habits.16 In this respect, 
miRNAs could also reflect the impact of the GFD on 
CD subjects. Furthermore, diet modulates the gut 
microbiome composition and dietary regimes rich 
in fibers and poor in animal-based products drive 
a selection of specific taxa.17 In parallel, many studies 
have associated gut microbiome dysbiosis and 
several gastrointestinal disorders, including CD.18 
Intriguingly, there is evidence of mutual regulation 
between fecal miRNAs and host gut microbiota 
mediated by diet-induced microbial metabolites.19– 
21 All these findings suggest that the diet-intestinal 
microbiota-miRNA axis could be crucial for regulating 
the host gene expression.22 However, the effect 
of GFD on this regulatory axis is still unexplored.

In the present study, we analyzed stool miRNA 
and other sncRNA profiles as well as the gut microbiome 
composition in treated CD (tCD) individuals 
on GFD. The aim was to explore specific 
patterns related to a strict dietary regime (with 
negative TG serology) or a not strict/short time 
adherence to GFD (with related gastrointestinal 
symptoms and positive TG serology). In addition, 
we also investigated whether the GFD length 
impacts the profiles of host and microbial 
investigated molecular features. Finally, we integrated 
outcomes from small RNA, shotgun metagenomic 
sequencing, and food/nutrient intake to 
explore host-gut microbial crosstalk in relation 
to GFD.

Patients and Materials and methods

Study population

One hundred and thirty-two subjects were enrolled 
by the Italian Institute for Genomic Medicine 
(IIGM), the Gastroenterology Unit of Ospedale 
Mauriziano Umberto I and the Gastroenterology 
outpatient clinic of San Giovanni Antica Sede, all in 
Turin, Italy. The cohort included tCD (n = 63), 
untreated CD (i.e., recruited before starting the 
GFD; n = 3), and healthy volunteers with no dietary 
restrictions (n = 66). For all participants, the inclusion 
criteria were as follows: no use of antibiotics 
and other drugs in the month before sampling, age 
>18, and no concomitant gastrointestinal disorders 
(e.g., allergies/intolerances, diabetes, inflammatory 
bowel diseases, or tumors). For CD subjects, 
besides the aforementioned criteria, a histological 
confirmation of the disease diagnosis was also 
required. The TG IgA levels were measured in 
serum samples of all subjects who provided blood 
for the present study, unless not already clinically 
tested in concomitance with the recruitment.

All participants signed an informed consent to 
participate in the study and received two questionnaires 
from the European Prospective Investigation 
into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study (one on 
dietary habits and another, sex-specific, about lifestyle 
habits)23 and a disposable container for stool 
collection.

To validate the relevant differences in stool 
miRNA profiles/microbiome composition, small 
RNA-sequencing/metagenome data from an independent 
group of 40 healthy omnivorous adult 
individuals were compared with those of the 
study population hereby recruited. This cohort is 
fully described by Tarallo et al.16 Finally, additional 
small RNA-sequencing data from 38 pediatric subjects 
were included in this study to compare 
miRNA profiles observed in untreated CD/tCD- 
TG+ adult subjects. This set of patients was 

recruited within an ongoing research study in collaboration 
with the Gastroenterology Unit of the 
Regina Margherita Children’s Hospital (Torino, 
Italy). The group included children between 3 and 
14 years old with a new diagnosis of CD (n = 19), 
untreated, and sex/age-matched with controls 
(n = 19). The inclusion criteria for these subjects 
were as follows: 1) negative medical history of 
concomitant or previous gastrointestinal diseases 
(including tumors) and 2) serological and histological 
verification/exclusion of the CD diagnosis.

The study was conducted according to the 
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local 
Ethics committees (Azienda Ospedaliera- 
Universitaria, Città della Salute e della Scienza di 
Torino, Protocols n.0030717 and n.0085713).

Dietary information

The EPIC Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) 
was used to determine the daily intake of foods/ 
beverages whose nutrient composition was 
obtained from the Italian food composition 
tables.24 The composition of 24 gluten-containing 
foods listed in the FFQ was modified for the celiac 
population to include the recipes of composite or 
generic gluten-free foods.25

Stool RNA and DNA isolation

The sample collection is described in 
Supplementary Materials. RNA was extracted 
from 200 µl aliquots using stool total RNA purification 
kit (Norgen Biotek Corp.) following manufacturer’s 
protocol. RNA quality and quantity were 
verified following the MIQE guidelines (http:// 
miqe.gene-quantification.info/). The RNA concentration 
was quantified with the Qubit microRNA 
assay kit (Invitrogen). The DNA was extracted with 
the DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit (Qiagen) following 
manufacturer’s instructions with a higher final elution 
buffer volume (50 µl) to increase DNA concentration 
which was quantified with Qubit DNA 
high-sensitivity assay kit (Invitrogen).

Small RNA-sequencing

Small RNA transcripts were converted into barcoded 
cDNA libraries using the NEBNext 
multiplex small RNA library prep set for Illumina 
(New England BioLabs), starting with 250 ng of 
RNA for each sample. The libraries were sequenced 
on Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Illumina) at the Gene 
Core Facility, Heidelberg (Germany). The complete 
procedure is described in26 and in 
Supplementary Materials. Raw small RNA- 
sequencing data were deposited at Gene 
Expression Omnibus with the identifier 
GSE217915.

Shotgun metagenomics

Metagenomic sequencing of DNA from stool was 
done using the Illumina DNA Prep kit (Illumina) 
described in27 and performed on the NovaSeq 6000 
Sequencing System (Illumina). Read pre- 
processing and alignment on PhiX control, as well 
as human genome were performed as in the study 
by Thomas et al.27 and fully described in 
Supplementary Materials. Raw sequencing data 
were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive 
(SRA) with the identifier PRJNA904924.

Statistical and computational analyses

Statistical analyses were performed with R v4.0.4. Age 
and sex-adjusted differential expression analysis was 
performed with DESeq2 v1.22.2 (LRT function),28 
adjusting for multiple testing by Benjamini– 
Hochberg method. Correlation analyses were performed 
using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient 
(SCC) and the analysis of monotonic miRNA 
expression trend using the Mann–Kendall test.

DIABLO module of MixOmics v.6.14.1 was used 
to integrate microbial profiles, differentially 
expressed miRNA levels, and dietary 
information,29 while classification analysis for the 
feature selection was performed with Weka v.3.8.5 
with the CfsSubsetEval module. A detailed description 
is provided in Supplementary Materials.

Results

Population characteristics

In this study, 63 tCD, 3 untreated CD individuals, 
and 66 sex- and age-matched healthy controls, all 
adults and without specific dietary restrictions, 
were recruited (Figure 1a, Table 1, and 
Supplementary Table S1a).

The mean age of tCD subjects was 
42.0 ± 14.5 years, and there was a prevalence of 
females (75%) (Table 1). No significant differences 
in BMI and smoking habits were observed between 
tCD subjects and healthy controls. The mean serological 
levels of vitamin D3 were higher in tCD 
individuals (61.1 ± 108.2 ng/ml) compared to controls 
(39.9 ± 70.8 ng/ml, p < .0001) due to the use of 
vitamin supplements, as reported in the questionnaires 
by one-third of tCD subjects (data not 
shown).

Fifty-one tCD individuals were on a strict GFD 
and tested negative for TG IgA antibodies (hereafter 
defined as tCD-TG-) at recruitment. The 
remaining 12 tCD subjects, presenting gastrointestinal 
symptoms at recruitment or starting the 
GFD in close proximity to it (i.e., from 1 to 
3 months) or declaring to not strictly follow an 
appropriate dietary regime, all tested positive for 
TG IgA antibodies (hereafter defined as tCD-TG+). 
The three untreated CD subjects were also characterized 
by high levels of TG IgA antibodies 
(untreated CD-TG+).

The weekly intake of specific foods/drinks and 
the estimated daily nutrient intake are summarized 
in Supplementary Table S1b. Vitamin E intake 
(mg/day) was higher in tCD-TG- and tCD-TG+ 
subjects than in controls (p < .001 and p < .01, 
respectively), while intake of polyunsaturated fatty 
acids (PUFAs) other than linoleic, linolenic, and 
oleic acids resulted lower in the same comparisons 
(p < .001 and p < .05, respectively) (Figure 1b and 
Supplementary Table S1b). A higher intake of vitamin 
B6, thiamine, and phosphorus characterized 
the tCD-TG- group with respect to controls 
(p < .01), while alcohol consumption was lower in 
tCD-TG+ with respect to both the other study 
groups (p < .01).

Stool miRNA profiles

An average of 122,382 small RNA-sequencing 
reads were aligned to human miRNome with an 
average of 756 miRNAs detected per sample 
(Supplementary Table S2a).

An age- and sex-adjusted miRNA differential 
expression analysis was performed among tCD-TG-, 
tCD-TG+, and controls. In total, 109 differentially

expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified 
(Figure 2a and Supplementary Table S3a), with 44 in 
tCD-TG- (17 up- and 27 down-regulated) and 53 in 
tCD-TG+ (39 up- and 14 down-regulated) compared 
to controls. Seven DEmiRNAs were dysregulated in 
both tCD groups with respect to controls. Finally, 
comparing tCD-TG+ and tCD-TG-, 25 DEmiRNAs 
(2 down- and 23 up-regulated in tCD-TG+) were 
identified (Figure 2a).

The profiles of the 109 DEmiRNAs observed 
in the tCD groups were compared with those of 
an independent cohort of 40 healthy omnivores 
(average age 40.5 ± 13.2, 24 females and 16 
males, Supplementary Table S1a) analyzed in 
our lab,16 reporting a coherent differential 
expression (SCC = 0.90, p < .001) and confirming 
77 DEmiRNAs (Figure 2b and 
Supplementary Table S3b). Five miRNAs (miR- 
944-5p, miR-3934-3p, miR-1229-5p, miR-4672- 
5p, and miR-4447) out of the seven identified 
as differentially expressed in both tCD groups 
when compared to healthy individuals were confirmed 
as significantly altered also in this second 
comparison. In contrast, in the individual categories, 
28 and 37 miRNAs were confirmed in 
tCD-TG- and tCD-TG+, respectively.

Clustering analysis based on the expression 
changes of the 109 DEmiRNAs highlighted four 
distinct sets: 51 specifically up-regulated miRNAs 
in tCD-TG+ (cluster 1), 18 and 22 miRNAs, 
respectively, up- (cluster 2) and down-regulated 
(cluster 3) in both tCD groups, and 18 miRNAs 
down-regulated in tCD-TG+ (cluster 4) 
(Figure 2c). The differences in expression of 
miRNAs belonging to cluster 1 and cluster 4 were 
reduced between tCD-TG- and healthy subjects,

regulated based on the miRNA expression change.

corresponding to similar levels in these groups. In 
particular, 21 of these miRNAs showed an opposite 
expression trend as the one observed for the tCD- 
TG+ when compared with healthy subjects.

Stool tCD-TG- DEmiRNA profiles in relation to GFD 
length

To further explore the relationship between 
miRNA dysregulation and GFD length, 
a correlation analysis was performed between 
DEmiRNA levels in tCD-TG- subjects and the 
years of GFD. The analysis highlighted five 
miRNAs that were significantly related to the 
length of the dietary regime: miR-3934-3p 
(SCC = -0.32), miR-4279-3p (SCC = -0.37), miR- 
4533-3p (SCC = -0.32), and miR-509-3p 
(SCC = -0.25), as negatively correlated, and miR- 
2681-3p as positively (SCC = 0.35) (Figure 2d and 
Supplementary Table S3c). The levels of these 
miRNAs were not concomitantly related to subjects’ 
age (Figure 2d and Supplementary Table 
S3c). After stratification of tCD-TG- subjects 
according to different GFD length categories, the 
differences in miRNA levels between tCD-TG- and 
healthy controls were reduced or increased with 
increasing years of adherence to the diet for some 
miRNAs as miR-4533-3p and miR-2681-3p 
(Supplementary Figure S1a).

Profiles of tCD-TG+ DEmiRNAs in untreated CD-TG+ 
subjects

To evaluate whether the DEmiRNA dysregulation 
observed in tCD-TG+ could be mirrored in the 
active form of untreated CD, we were able to 
recruit only three CD-TG+ adult subjects before 
they started the GFD. Since this number of individuals 
was not statistically sufficient for robust differential 
expression analyses, the data from these 
subjects were merged with those from tCD-TG+ 
and the comparison with healthy controls repeated. 
The outcomes of the analysis confirmed 57 of the 
60 DEmiRNAs in this comparison, including the 
seven DEmiRNAs in overlap with the tCD-TG-. 
Among the confirmed DEmiRNAs, nine showed 
a significant trend of expression (p < .05) going 
from untreated CD-TG+, tCD-TG+, and tCD-TG- 
to controls, with three progressively increasing and 
six decreasing (Supplementary Figure 1B and 
Supplementary Table S3c).

Additionally, given the limited number of 
untreated CD-TG+ in the cohort, we explored stool 
miRNA profiles from small RNA-sequencing data of 
an ongoing study on untreated pediatric CD patients 
(n = 19, average age = 10.4 ± 3.1, 9 females and 10 
males, Supplementary Table S1a) matched for sex and 
age with healthy controls (n = 19, average 
age = 9.9 ± 3.2). Thirty-two (53%) of the 60 
DEmiRNAs observed in the adult tCD-TG+ were 
characterized by a coherent expression with those of 
the pediatric CD-TG+ subjects (23 up-regulated and 9 
down-regulated) compared to healthy controls 
(SCC = 0.68, p < .001) (Supplementary Figure S1c). 
Three out of the 32 coherently altered miRNAs were 
also dysregulated (p < .05) in the group of untreated 
CD-TG+ children, including miR-7158-3p, one of the 
nine miRNAs associated with a significant expression 
trend from adult untreated CD-TG+ to healthy subjects 
(Supplementary Table S3d and Supplementary 
Figure S1c,d).

miRNA target enrichment analysis

The functional analysis of the four identified clusters 
of DEmiRNAs (Figure 2c) highlighted 372 enriched 
biological processes that were merged in 45 groups 
based on their semantic similarity (adj. p < .05, 
Supplementary Table S4a). Specifically, cluster 1 
DEmiRNAs were mainly associated with inflammatory 
pathways (i.e., leukocyte chemotaxis involved in 
inflammatory response, negative regulation of translation 
in response to stress, negative regulation of regulatory 
T cell differentiation), intestinal absorption, and 
transmembrane transport pathways (i.e., regulation of 
intestinal cholesterol absorption, folate import across 
plasma membrane). Cluster 2 DEmiRNAs were 
enriched in terms related to apoptosis (i.e., regulation 
of intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in response to 
DNA damage, or intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, 
negative regulation of intrinsic apoptotic signaling 
pathway) and glucose transport (i.e., negative regulation 
of glucose import, negative regulation of glucose 
transmembrane transport), while cluster 3 
DEmiRNAs were enriched in pathways connected to 
immune response (i.e., positive regulation of interleukin 
6 biosynthetic process, T cell activation involved in 
immune response, macrophage activation, interleukin 

1ß production). Finally, cluster 4 DEmiRNAs were 
mainly enriched in endoplasmic reticulum stress 
(i.e., regulation of translation in response to endoplasmic 
reticulum stress or negative regulation of response 
to endoplasmic reticulum stress).

Investigating the individual miRNA-target 
annotations, miR-6756-5p/miR-4447 targeting 
DDX39B was supported by the highest number of 
evidence (n = 48), followed by miR-181b-5p- 
HSPA1B (n = 20), miR-148a-3p/miR-139-3p targeting 
HLA-A, miR-6835-5p-DDX39B, and miR- 
7851-3p-MICB interactions (both with n = 16) 
(Supplementary Table S4b,c).

Other fecal sncRNA profiles

An average of 416,834 reads were assigned to 
sncRNA annotations other than miRNAs, with an 
average of 2,356 detected sncRNAs (Supplementary 
Table S2a). Sixteen sncRNAs were significantly up- 
regulated in tCD-TG+ vs controls (Supplementary 
Table S5a and Supplementary Figure S2), including 
11 piRNAs and 5 tRNAs. All 16 sncRNAs were also 
up-regulated in tCD-TG+ vs tCD-TG- (piR-43815 
being statistically significant). The expression levels 
of the 16 DEsncRNAs up-regulated in tCD-TG+ 
were validated in the independent group, with five 
of them significant (piR-58832, piR-47969, piR- 
57921, tRNA-Phe (GAA), and piR-34680) 
(Supplementary Table S5b).

Stool microbial profiles

An average of 44,458,589 metagenomic sequencing 
reads were generated for each sample (Supplementary 
Table S2b). Overall, 105 microbial species were 
detected on average in each sample and no significant 
differences emerged comparing the population heterogeneity 
(a-diversity) (Supplementary Table S6a). 
At phylum level, a substantial reduction of 
Actinobacteria (log2 fold change (log2FC) = 1.38; 
p < .001), Verrucomicrobia (log2FC = -1.17; 
p < .01) and an increase in Bacteroidetes 
(log2FC = 0.11; p < .05) abundances were reported 
in tCD-TG- with respect to controls (Supplementary 
Table S6b). The tCD-TG+ group showed a reduction 
of Euryarchaeota (log2FC = -5.46; p < .05) and an 
increase of Fusobacteria (log2FC = 0.24; p < .05) 
abundance in comparison with controls, while no 
differences between both tCD groups were observed 
(Supplementary Table S6b).

At the species level, Bifidobacterium longum, 
Roseburia sp. CAG 309, Ruminococcus bicirculans, 
Ruminococcus callidus, and Eubacterium sp. CAG 
274 were less abundant in tCD-TG- with respect to 
controls (log2FC from -1.74 to -0.51; adj. p < .05) 
while Roseburia inulinivorans resulted more abundance 
(log2FC = 0.61; adj. p < .05, Figure 3a and 
Supplementary Table S6c). Conversely, in tCD-TG+, 
Veillonella atypica, Veillonella tobetsuensis, 
Streptococcus sanguinis, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae 
were more abundant (log2FC from 1.43 to 
0.18; adj. p < .05), while Firmicutes bacterium CAG 83 
and R. bicirculans were reduced (log2FC of -2.88 and 
-1.70, respectively; adj. p < .05, Figure 3b and 
Supplementary Table S6d). No differences were 
observed between the two tCD groups 
(Supplementary Table S6e). Microbial abundances 
and the GFD duration significantly correlated for 
H. parainfluenzae (SCC = -0.31) and S. sanguinis 
(SCC = -0.26) (Supplementary Table S6f), but the 
latter also correlated with the subject age 
(SCC = -0.26). The differential abundance of species 
mentioned above was confirmed by repeating the 
comparisons with the independent group of controls: 
all the species reported the same abundance alteration, 
with six and five of them statistically significant in 
tCD-TG- and tCD-TG+ compared to controls, 
respectively (Supplementary Table S6g). In addition, 
analysis of stool metagenomic profile of the 19 pediatric 
CD-TG+ patients with respect to healthy controls 
showed an increase (log2FC = 2.05) of Veillonella 
atypica levels in patient samples, albeit not significant 
(Supplementary Table S6g).

unctional profiling of gut metagenomes highlighted 
18 microbial pathways with a significantly 
different gene abundance among the groups 
(Figure 3c and Supplementary Table S6h). 
Overall, compared with controls, both tCD groups 
showed a lower abundance in microbial genes 
involved in the 4-hydroxybenzoate biosynthesis, 
starch biosynthesis, Bifidobacterium shunt, and 
amino acids biosynthesis (L-arginine biosynthesis 
I, II, and IV) and a higher abundance in nitrate 
reduction and L-rhamnose degradation. Nitrate 
reduction I pathway was negatively correlated 
with the years of GFD (SCC = -0.26) (Figure 3c 
and Supplementary Table S6f).

Integration of miRNA, microbiome, and nutrient 
intake data

Integrative analysis with DIABLO showed good 
efficiency in discriminating both tCD groups 
from controls based on stool DEmiRNAs and gut 
microbial profiles, but not nutrient intake 
(Figure 4a), supported by the high correlation 
between DEmiRNA and microbial profiles 
observed for both variates (Figure 4b). Candidate 
miRNA–microbiome interactions involving the 
most discriminating miRNAs and microbes 
(Supplementary Figure S3a) were explored by pairwise 
correlation analysis (Supplementary Table

Identification of features characterizing CD subjects 
on GFD

Starting from the features selected by the DIABLO 
analysis, a classification analysis was applied to 
identify the minimal set with the best classification 
potential (Supplementary Table S7a). Respectively, 
16, 16, and 9 features were able to classify all tCD 
subjects (Accuracy = 88.8%, AUC = 0.94) tCD-TG- 
(Accuracy = 87.0%, AUC = 0.96) and tCD-TG+ 
(Accuracy = 88.2%, AUC = 0.85) with respect to 
controls (Supplementary Figure S3b upper panels 
and Supplementary Table S7a,b). Testing the same 
features between tCD subjects and the independent 
cohort of controls confirmed their discriminating 
efficiency (Supplementary Figure S3b lower panels 
and Supplementary Table S7a).

A subset of features specifically distinguished 
each of the two tCD groups from controls. miR- 
1229-5p, miR-3154, miR-641, miR-4313-3p, miR- 
4672-5p, B. longum, Collinsella stercoris, 
Eisenbergiella tayi, Enterorhabdus caecimuris, 
Paraprevotella xylaniphila, R. inulinivorans, 
Veillonella dispar, and the PUFA intake were the 
features pertaining the classification between tCD- 
TG- and controls. Conversely, miR-3180, miR-662, 
Anaeromassilibacillus sp. An250 Allisonella histaminiformans, 
and the total saturated fatty-acids 
and linoleic acid intake characterized the signature 
discriminating tCD-TG+ from controls. 
R. bicirculans, vitamin E, and total lipid intake 
were the features of both identified feature sets 
(Supplementary Table S7b).

Discussion

This study represents the first characterization of 
stool sncRNAs in CD patients on GFD with 
a concomitant description of their gut microbiota. 
For several miRNAs, a differential expression was 
observed in tCD-TG- and tCD-TG+ subjects with 
respect to controls negative for TG antibody levels. 
In tCD-TG+, some miRNAs were dysregulated 
both in comparison with the controls and, following 
the same trend, with tCD-TG-. This aspect may 
be ascribed to the fact that tCD-TG+ reported 
gastrointestinal symptoms and tested positive for 
TG antibody levels due either to an incorrect or 
a very recent adherence to the GFD. One of the 
well-known effects of GFD in CD patients is the 
reduction of duodenal inflammation. In the present 
research, coherently, the targets of DEmiRNAs 
up-regulated in tCD-TG+ were involved in inflammatory-
response-related pathways, which are 
widely associated with CD.1 Among them, miR- 
148-3p was previously reported to regulate the 
inflammatory dendritic cell differentiation in autoimmune 
disorders30 and macrophage 
differentiation,31 as well as inhibit gut inflammation 
in a mouse model of colitis.32 Instead, miR- 
181b-5p, another miRNA up-regulated in tCD-TG 
+, was described as an effector of Signal transducer 
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and NF- 
.B signaling.33,34 The altered expression of these 
inflammation-related miRNAs in stool of tCD-TG 
+ individuals could be explained by an inflammatory 
response triggered by the gluten ingestion.35 
Similarly, the targets of the DEmiRNAs down- 
regulated in tCD-TG+ were involved in the activation 
of eIF2a/PERK axis in response to endoplasmic 
reticulum stress, a process previously 
described in autoimmune diseases,36,37 including 
CD.38

Besides reflecting changes in the inflammatory 
state of the intestinal tissues, the observed stool 
DEmiRNAs could mirror epigenetic modifications 
in gut cells driven by a long-term dietary 
regime. Interestingly, miR-638-3p, significantly 
more abundant in tCD-TG- subjects, was 
among the most significantly represented in 
feces from vegan/vegetarian subjects in Tarallo 
et al.16 miR-638 was previously related to CD, 
where its overexpression was detected in duodenal 
biopsies.39 Notably, the TG-coding gene 
(TGM2) is among the predicted targets of this 
miRNA. Other eight DEmiRNAs (miR-2681-3p, 
miR-599, miR-423-5p, miR-6832-5p, miR-12120, 
miR-4313-3p, miR-1291, and miR-6081-5p), more 
abundant in tCD-TG- compared to tCD-TG+ 
and controls, could represent promising molecules 
to investigate the long-term effect of GFD. 
Several miRNAs correlated with the GFD length 
irrespectively of subjects’ age, including the previously 
mentioned miR-2681-3p. These results 

further support the role of diet on the modulation 
of miRNA expression over time, as previously 
observed.16 As an additional interesting 
aspect, compared to subjects who recently started 
the GFD, those with a longer adherence showed 
levels of miR-4533-3p and miR-2681-3p fairly 
similar to controls, suggesting a possible recovery 
to a physiological level of the expression of these 
miRNAs over the years. Although more studies 
are needed to elucidate the molecular activity of 
these miRNAs, our findings provide evidence of 
the role of long-term dietary changes in reprogramming 
the post-transcriptional regulatory 
network of intestinal cells, which is reflected in 
stool samples. However, to better understand 
how GFD affects stool miRNA expression, it 
would also be pivotal to investigate their profiles 
in healthy subjects on GFD.

Stool levels of seven miRNAs were coherently significantly 
altered in both tCD-TG- and tCD-TG+. 
These overlapping DEmiRNAs may be related to 
genetic/epigenetic changes associated with the pathology 
itself and not necessarily to the GFD adherence. 
The functional analysis showed that the target genes 
of these DEmiRNAs are involved in the integrin- 
mediated signaling pathways (Supplementary Table 
S4a). The key role of integrins in triggering immune 
mechanisms has been largely described, even if their 
involvement in the onset and progression of autoimmune 
diseases (including CD) remains elusive.40 This 
set of miRNAs could have potential future applications 
in clinical trials for the diagnosis and monitoring 
of CD as well as therapeutic targets to reduce 
villous atrophy.

Stool profiling of other sncRNAs besides 
miRNAs highlighted altered levels of some 
piRNAs and tRNAs in tCD subjects, with 
a marked up-regulation in tCD-TG+. This novel 
finding suggests that such molecules could have an 
unexplored role in the regulatory networks associated 
with CD and their expression may be modulated 
by GFD. The role of sncRNAs other than 
miRNAs has been scarcely investigated41 and, especially 
for piRNAs, their sequences are sometimes 
similar and highly repeated in the human genome, 
making their functional characterization non- 
trivial. Further analyses are needed to clarify the 
role of these molecules in relation to CD and GFD.

In the present study, exploring the gut microbiome 
composition at phylum level, we confirmed 
a reduction in Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia 
and an increase in Bacteroidetes abundances in tCD- 
TG-subjects, while Euryarchaeota and Fusobacteria 
were specifically reduced in tCD-TG+.42,43 At species 
levels, a decrease of B. longum was observed in both 
tCD groups, coherently with previous 
observations.44,45 Interestingly, a specific strain of 
this bacterium, namely B. longum CECT 7347, was 
observed to reduce the production of inflammatory 
cytokines, CD4+ T cells and peripheral CD3+ T 
lymphocytes46 and its oral administration ameliorated 
the enteropathy induced by gliadin ingestion.47 In 
addition, S. sanguinis, more abundant in tCD-TG+, 
was also increased in the saliva of CD patients compared 
to controls.48 Interestingly, S. sanguinis and 
H. parainfluenzae were negatively correlated with 
the GFD years, supporting that the GFD adherence 
could restore a microbial abundance comparable to 
that of healthy controls.

Microbial functional profiling revealed in tCD- 
TG- a lower abundance of genes involved in starch 
metabolism. This is in line with the adherence to 
GFD, which includes gluten-free products characterized 
by a different content of starch and 
carbohydrates.49 This aspect was also supported 
by the nutrient intake data showing a lower starch 
intake in tCD-TG- individuals with respect to controls 
(Supplementary Table S1). Conversely, the 
abundance of genes involved in the nitrate reduction 
process was increased in tCD-TG+ and 
(although not significantly) also in tCD-TG- 
group with respect to healthy controls, and this 
metabolic pathway was negatively correlated with 
the years of GFD. This finding is consistent with 
previous observations on the reduction of nitrate 
catabolites, particularly nitric oxide (NO), in duodenal 
tissue, urine, and plasma of CD patients on 
a GFD.50 Indeed, NO is a well-known biomarker of 
intestinal inflammation,51 and the reduction of 
microbial taxa annotated with the nitrate reduction 
pathway might be related to the decrease in duodenal 
inflammation related to the GFD.

The observed alterations in miRNA and microbial 
profiles may also be due to an effect of the 
specific nutrient intake. Although no single correlation 
between the DEmiRNA levels/microbial species 
abundances and the nutrient intakes reached 
the statistical significance after adjustment for multiple 
tests (Supplementary Table S1c), some of 
these correlations may deserve further investigation. 
This includes a moderate positive correlation 
between linolenic acid and miR-635-3p levels and 
negative correlations between folic acid and miR- 
4309-3p, as well as between Vitamin E and miR- 
596. For microbial species and nutrient intake, the 
most relevant but still not significant correlation 
was observed between R. inulinivorans and vitamin 
C and beta-carotene. Given these results, we can 
conclude that no single nutrient strongly influenced 
the study outcomes, accordingly with the 
limited differences observed in the dietary pattern 
between tCD-TG- and healthy subjects. However, 
we cannot rule out a possible cumulative effect due 
to the small effects of the variegated intake of 
multiple nutrients.

In contrast, the observed correlations among 
miRNAs and microbes altered in tCD subjects provide 
evidence of candidate host-microbial interactions 
in this disease. For instance, P. copri, even if 
not significantly differentially abundant among the 
analyzed groups, was related to the highest number 
of DEmiRNAs, followed by R. bicirculans. P. copri 
abundances progressively decreased in stool from 
tCD-TG+ and tCD-TG- to controls. Conversely, 
R. bicirculans had an opposite trend with increasing 
abundances going from tCD-TG+ to controls. 
Although the literature concerning this bacterium 
is still scarce, a recent study supported its ability to 
utilize certain hemicelluloses, especially ß-glucans 
and xyloglucan for its growth.52 In addition, an 
increased abundance of this bacterium has been 
reported in relation to a high-protein low-fat 
weight reduction diet53 and a low calorie weight 
loss diet supplemented with resistant starch.54 This 
is in line with the previously mentioned lower 
starch intake and related metabolism observed for 
the tCD groups, which could partially explain its 
reduction in those categories. Moreover, 
R. bicirculans lower abundance was recently associated 
with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
severity55 and alopecia areata.56 Considering its 
abundance reduction, especially in the tCD-TG+, 
its possible involvement in inflammatory/autoimmune 
processes cannot be excluded. Interestingly, 
a high abundance of Prevotella and a low representation 
of the Ruminococcus genus were observed in 
stool samples of a Rhesus macaque model of CD.57 
In the same study, inflammation-related miRNAs 
were up-regulated in the jejunum of gluten- 
sensitive animals and some of them were predicted 
to interact with bacterial 16S. However, despite 
evidence emerging on functional interactions 
between host small RNAs and microbial genes,22 
further analyses are needed to clarify the miRNA- 
bacteria relations observed in our research.

The integration of miRNome, microbiome, and 
daily nutrient intake data showed the ability to 
discriminate CD categories from controls, with 
the major contribution provided by specific 
DEmiRNAs and microbial species. Nutrient intake 
data alone could not distinguish the analyzed 
groups, as expected, given that all the CD subjects 
were on GFD and limited differences were 
observed in the nutrient intake. Interestingly, only 
a small overlap was observed comparing the signature 
of features distinguishing tCD-TG- or tCD- 
TG+ with respect to controls (except for Vitamin 
E and R. bicirculans). This suggests that the identified 
markers may precisely characterize the effects 
of long-term GFD adherence or a perturbation 
related to a gut inflammatory state.

Despite the promising results, a limitation of the 
present study was the small number of tCD-TG+ 
and untreated CD-TG+ adult individuals recruited. 
Indeed, although in the latter group we observed 
coherent alterations with tCD-TG+ for some of the 
identified DEmiRNAs as well as microbial relative 
abundances, we could not analyze these subjects as 
an independent group, due to its limited sample 
size. However, we tried to overcome this limitation 
by analyzing a pilot dataset from pediatric 
untreated CD-TG+ subjects, in which most 
DEmiRNA alterations were also confirmed.

Conversely, this work presents various 
strengths: 1) being the first observational study 
using a miRNome-wide approach on fecal samples 
of CD patients; 2) among the few investigations 
assessing gut microbiome composition by shotgun 
metagenomic sequencing in relation to the 
disease;45 3) correlating microbial relative 

abundances and host miRNome profiles from the 
same specimens of the same subjects; 4) including 
a healthy control group recruited and analyzed in 
concomitance with CD subjects, matched for age 
and gender and with negative TG serology; and, 
finally, 5) providing the validation of the observed 
miRNA and microbiome alterations by comparing 
findings with an independent group of healthy 
controls, or, for stool miRNAs alone, with 
a group of newly diagnosed untreated CD-TG+ 
children.

In conclusion, we showed the modulation of 
several human miRNAs in relation to GFD 
adherence in CD subjects which can be assessed 
in fecal samples. Interestingly, the expression 
levels of some of these miRNAs, over the years 
of the dietary regime, show reduced differences 
with respect to healthy subjects. Conversely, the 
short/not strict adherence to GFD confirmed 
molecular alterations of inflammatory pathways 
related to CD. Similarly, the microbiome composition 
reflected the active status of the disease or 
GFD compliance, confirming previous findings 
in the literature. Finally, as a novel finding, the 
integrated analysis of fecal miRNAs and gut 
microbial species supports the host-microbiota 
crosstalk in physiological and pathological conditions 
and may provide composite noninvasive 
molecular biomarkers for GFD adherence 
monitoring.
