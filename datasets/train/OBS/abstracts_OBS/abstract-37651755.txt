BACKGROUND: Kumquat decoction is a traditional Chinese medicine formula and has 
been widely used to alleviate the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related 
cough in China. However, the effectiveness and safety of kumquat decoction 
remain unclear.
PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness and safety of kumquat decoction for 
COVID-19-related cough.
STUDY DESIGN: A multicentre, prospective observational study.
METHODS: We enrolled consecutive patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 from 
December 31, 2022, to January 3, 2023, during the Omicron phase in Yangshuo 
County, China. The primary outcome was the time from study baseline to sustained 
cough resolution by the last follow-up day on January 31, 2023. The 
effectiveness was evaluated by Cox proportional hazards models based on 
propensity score analyses. The secondary outcomes were the resolution of cough 
and other COVID-19-related symptoms by Days 3, 5, and 7.
RESULTS: Of 1434 patients, 671 patients were excluded from the analysis of cough 
resolution. Among the remaining 763 patients, 481 (63.04%) received kumquat 
decoction, and 282 (36.96%) received usual care. The median age was 38.0 
(interquartile range [IQR] 29.0, 50.0) years, and 55.7% were women. During a 
median follow-up of 7.000 days, 68.2% of patients in the kumquat group achieved 
sustained cough resolution (93.77 per 1000 person-days) compared to 39.7% in the 
usual care group (72.94 per 1000 person-days). The differences in restricted 
mean survival time (RMST) (kumquat decoction minus usual care group) for cough 
resolution were -0.742 days (95% CI, -1.235 to -0.250, P = 0.003) on Day 7. In 
the main analysis using propensity-score matching, the adjusted hazard ratio 
(HR) for cough resolution (kumquat decoction vs. usual care group) was 1.94 (95% 
CI, 1.48 to 2.53, P < 0.001). Similar findings were found in multiple 
sensitivity analyses. In addition, the use of kumquat decoction was associated 
with the resolution of cough, and a stuffy nose on Days 5 and 7, as well as the 
resolution of sore throat on Day 7 following medication.
CONCLUSION: In this study among patients with COVID-19-related cough, receiving 
kumquat decoction was associated with an earlier resolution of cough symptoms.
