1/PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess decisions, attitudes, and   understanding of participants (patients, parents, relatives) having genome   sequencing for rare disease diagnosis.  
2/METHODS: This study involved a cross-sectional observational survey with   participants in the 100,000 Genomes Project.  
3/RESULTS: Survey response rate was 51% (504/978). Most participants self-reported   that they had decided to undergo genome sequencing (94%) and that this was an   informed decision (84%) with low decisional conflict (95%). Most self-reported   that they had chosen to receive additional findings (88%) and that this was an   informed decision (89%) with low decisional conflict (95%). Participants were   motivated more by the desire to help others via research than by the belief it   would help them obtain a diagnosis (Z = 14.23, P = 5.75 × 10-46), although both   motivations were high. Concerns were relatively few but, where expressed, were   more about the potential psychological impact of results than data   sharing/access (Z = 9.61, P = 7.65 × 10-22). Concerns were higher among male,   Asian or Asian British, and more religious participants. General and   context-specific understanding of genome sequencing were both moderately high   (means 5.2/9.0 and 22.5/28.0, respectively).  
4/CONCLUSION: These findings are useful to inform consent guidelines and clinical   implementation of genome sequencing.
