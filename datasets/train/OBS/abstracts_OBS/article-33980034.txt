Coronary atherosclerotic lesions composed of lipidrich 
plaque (LRP) underlie the majority of myocardial 
infarctions, as demonstrated postmortem1 and 
by intracoronary imaging in vivo.2–5 The immunologically 
active and inflammatory nature of some LRP likely contributes 
to their vulnerability, propensity for local destabilization, 
and triggering of site-specific coronary events.6,7 
After treating a culprit LRP with percutaneous coronary 
intervention (PCI), some degree of lipid content is frequently 
retained within the stented plaque.8,9 Whether 
retained LRP within the stented plaque remains active 

and continues to influence the local environment is 
unknown. If some degree of immunologic activity and 
inflammation persists poststenting, it is conceivable that 
retained LRP might be associated with a higher risk of 
subsequent target lesion failure (TLF). 

LRP can be reliably detected by intracoronary nearinfrared 
spectroscopy (NIRS).10,11 Whereas LRP has 
been studied at target lesion sites with combined NIRS 
and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) before stent placement,
4,5 the association between the retained target 
lesion lipid content detected by NIRS after PCI and 

subsequent coronary events has not been previously 
studied. Using combined NIRS-IVUS, the present study 
was performed to determine if target lesion lipid content 
detected by NIRS in the stented segment after PCI is 
associated with an increased risk of subsequent TLF 
during follow-up. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Study Population 

The data that support the findings of this study are available 
from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. The 
Spectrum NIRS-IVUS Registry is a single-center observational 
registry of prospectively enrolled patients undergoing 
combined NIRS-IVUS imaging at Spectrum Health in Grand 
Rapids, MI. Inclusion criteria for participation in the registry are 
age =18 years, referral to the catheterization laboratory for 
clinically indicated invasive coronary angiography or PCI, and 
performance of NIRS-IVUS imaging within the index target 
vessel.12,13 In all registry participants, clinical outcome data are 
collected prospectively after NIRS-IVUS imaging by study personnel 
blinded to the NIRS-IVUS imaging findings with phone 
calls at 6 months after the index procedure, 1 year after the 
index procedure, and then annually for a total of 5 years. This 
study was approved by the local institutional review board, and 
all participants provided written informed consent. 

To be included in this analysis, registry patients needed to 
meet all of the following criteria: at least one target lesion in a 
native coronary artery was treated with stent placement at the 
time of the index procedure; NIRS-IVUS imaging of the stented 
segment was performed after PCI was complete; and no additional 
balloon dilations or stent implantations were performed 
at the treated target lesion site during the index procedure after 
final NIRS-IVUS imaging was performed. Registry patients 
were excluded from this analysis if PCI was not performed, 
post-PCI NIRS-IVUS imaging was not performed, poststent 
NIRS-IVUS imaging was performed but additional postdilations 
or stent implantations were undertaken after final NIRS-IVUS 
imaging, PCI was performed for treatment of in-stent restenosis 
or stent thrombosis in a preexisting stent, PCI was performed 
in a bypass graft, bifurcation stenting was performed, or 

NIRS-IVUS Imaging and Analysis 

The decision to perform NIRS-IVUS imaging at the time of 
invasive angiography was at the discretion of the operating 
physician. The NIRS-IVUS catheter (TVC Imaging System, 
Infraredx, Burlington, MA) was advanced into the target vessel 
and motorized pullback was performed at 0.5 mm/s. 

NIRS-IVUS images were interpreted off-line by the atherosclerosis 
imaging core laboratory at Wakayama University 
(Wakayama, Japan). Investigators at the core laboratory were 
blinded to patient’s clinical data and outcomes. The proximal 
and distal margins of all coronary stents were identified and 
marked on the IVUS images. This simultaneously resulted in 
marking the location of the stent edges on the NIRS chemogram, 
as NIRS images are automatically coregistered to IVUS 
images at the time of image acquisition. The 5-mm margins 
proximal and distal to the stent edges were similarly marked. 
Quantitative IVUS analysis was performed along the entire 
length of the stent and in the 5-mm stent margins on cross-sectional 
images spaced 1-mm apart using commercially available 
software (CAAS IntraVascular, Pie Medical Imaging, Maastricht, 
Netherlands). The external elastic membrane, luminal contours, 
and stent contours were traced on each image. Plaque burden 
was calculated as (external elastic membrane area–lumen 
area)/external elastic membrane area×100. Plaque volume in 
the stented segment and in the stent margins was measured 
using the trapezoid rule for volumetric analysis. IVUS images 
were analyzed qualitatively for the presence of dissection in 
the proximal and distal stent margins. Target lesions treated by 
implanting two overlapping stents during the index procedure 
were analyzed as a single stent. 

NIRS images were considered uninterpretable and excluded 
from further analysis if the corresponding block chemogram 
was black in color, indicating the absence of reliable data. To 
assess the amount of residual lipid present within and adjacent 
to the stent after PCI, NIRS chemograms were interrogated for 

the lipid core burden index (LCBI) and the maximum LCBI in 4 
mm (maxLCBI4mm) in each stented segment and separately in 
each stent margin. LCBI is defined as the fraction of pixels indicating 
lipid within a region multiplied by 1000.4,5 MaxLCBI4mm 
is defined as the 4-mm region with the highest LCBI in the 
segment of interest.4,5 The detection of a residual large lipid 
core by NIRS having a maxLCBI4mm =400 in the stented segment 
or within the stent margins was also reported, as lipid-rich 
plaques of this size at nonstented sites have previously been 
associated with future cardiovascular events.13,14 NIRS images 
of target lesions before stent placement were evaluated for the 
prestent maxLCBI4mm. To understand how the NIRS-detected 
lipid content in the target lesions changed with stenting, the 
difference in prestent maxLCBI and poststent maxLCBI 

4mm 4mm 

was determined and reported as .maxLCBI4mm. 

Clinical Outcomes 

Two cardiologists blinded to the NIRS-IVUS findings independently 
adjudicated all clinical events using original source 
documents. Differing interpretations between the two adjudicators 
were resolved by a third independent cardiologist. 
The primary outcome evaluated in this study was TLF, defined 
as a composite of cardiovascular death, target vessel myocardial 
infarction, and clinically driven target lesion revascularization. 
The secondary outcomes reported were the 
individual components of the primary end point and definite 
stent thrombosis. Myocardial infarction was defined using the 
third universal definition of myocardial infarction.15 All other 
end points were defined according to the standardized definitions 
proposed by the Academic Research Consortium-2 
Consensus Document.16 

Statistical Analysis 

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize baseline characteristics 
and outcome measures. All continuous data were 
explored using histograms graphically and measures of normality 
to determine conformance to a normal distribution. Normally 
distributed continuous variables are shown as mean±SD. Nonnormally 
distributed continuous variables are shown as median 
[25th percentile, 75th percentile]. Categorical variables are 
shown as count (% frequency). 

The NIRS measures of exposure in the stented segment 
and in the stent margins were the LCBI and maxLCBI4mm. The 
binary variable of a maxLCBI4mm threshold of 400 was also 
evaluated. IVUS measures of exposure in the stented segment 
were stent length, plaque volume, maximum plaque burden, 
and several measures of stent expansion. Measures of stent 
expansion included minimum stent area (MSA), relative stent 
expansion compared to the average minimum lumen area 
(MLA) of the proximal and distal reference segments (calculated 
as MSA/MLA , where MLA is the average MLA of 

avg avg 

the proximal and distal reference segments), and relative stent 
expansion compared to the MLA of the distal reference segment 
(calculated as MSA/MLA , where MLA is the MLA of 

dist dist 

the distal reference segment). IVUS measures of exposure in 
the proximal and distal stent margins were MLA, plaque volume, 
maximum plaque burden, and the presence of dissection. 

Univariate comparisons of baseline clinical variables, as 
well as the primary and secondary measures of exposure by 
NIRS-IVUS imaging, were performed among patients with and 

without TLF during follow-up. P values for comparison of continuous 
variables were derived from 2 sample independent t 
tests if data were normally distributed or from Wilcoxon Rank-
Sum tests if data were not normally distributed. P values for 
comparison of categorical variables were generated with a .2 
analysis or a Fisher exact test if the expected cell counts were 
below 5 in >20% of the cells. 

Variables in the univariate comparison having a P value of 

<0.10 were assessed for inclusion in a multivariate logistic regression 
model to identify variables independently associated with TLF. 
Variables having a P<0.10 but with >5% missing values were 
excluded from the model. Although both maxLCBI4mm and LCBI in 
the stented segment met the criteria for inclusion in the model, only 
maxLCBI4mm was chosen for inclusion given the greater emphasis 
in prior studies between maxLCBI4mm and future coronary 
events.13,14 Backwards selection was completed to ensure any variables 
left in the model were significant at the P=0.05 level. To test 
the ability of residual maxLCBI4mm in the stented segment to differentiate 
treated target lesions with and without subsequent TLF, a 
receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed to generate 
a C statistic and to determine the optimal residual maxLCBI4mm 
threshold for identifying subsequent TLF. Calculations of the sensitivity 
and specificity of this threshold were performed. Cumulative 
TLF event rates among stented segments with a residual maxLCBI4mm 
above and below the optimal threshold determined by the 
receiver-operating characteristic analysis were performed using a 
Kaplan-Meier curve and compared using a log-rank test. All statistical 
analyses were generated using SAS (SAS Enterprise Guide 
software, Version 7.1; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). 
RESULTS 
Baseline Characteristics of the Study 
Population 

Between January 2012 and September 2016, a total of 
500 patients were prospectively enrolled into the NIRSIVUS 
registry. Of these, 202 (40.4%) patients with 209 
target lesions treated by PCI met inclusion criteria for this 
analysis and represent the study population (Figure 1). 
Among the study population, 191 (94.6%) patients 
had a baseline clinical presentation consistent with an 
acute coronary syndrome, including 102 (50.5%) who 
presented with a myocardial infarction (Table 1). Target 
lesions were treated with second-generation drug-eluting 
stents in 73.7% and bare-metal stents in 26.3%. After 
the index procedure, dual antiplatelet therapy and statins 
were utilized in 100% and 97.0% of patients, respectively. 

Target Lesion Failure 

Follow-up duration among the study population was 
3.5±1.4 years. During that time, TLF occurred in 16 
(7.7%) stented target lesions. TLF events were based 
on the occurrence of cardiovascular mortality in 4 
(2.0%), target vessel myocardial infarction in 3 (1.5%), 
and target lesion revascularization in 9 (4.3%). Among 
the 209 stented target lesions, definite stent thrombosis 
occurred in 1 (0.5%) lesion. At the patient level, 

Figure 1. Flowchart of registry patients included and excluded in this analysis. 

Shown is a flowchart with indications for patient exclusion in this analysis. IVUS indicates intravascular ultrasound; NIRS, near-infrared 
spectroscopy; and PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention. 

there were no significant differences in baseline clinical 
variables among patients with and without TLF during 
follow-up (Table 1). The use of drug-eluting stents at 
baseline was significantly lower among stented target 
lesions with (50.0%) versus without (75.7%) TLF during 
follow-up (P=0.04). 

Baseline NIRS-IVUS Findings and Subsequent 
TLF 

Baseline NIRS-IVUS findings among stented lesions 
with and without TLF during follow-up are presented 
in Table 2. Stented lesions with TLF had a greater 
retained lipid content after PCI compared with those 
without TLF, as demonstrated by a significantly greater 
residual maxLCBI4mm (297 [211, 401] versus 119 [9, 
258], P=0.006) and LCBI (99 [54, 148] versus 28 [2, 
86], P=0.008) in the stented segment. The post-PCI 
maxLCBI4mm and LCBI in the proximal and distal stent 
margins were not significantly associated with subsequent 
TLF (Table 2). Whereas NIRS findings in the 
stented segment after PCI were associated with subsequent 
TLF, NIRS findings in target lesions before 
stenting were not significantly associated with TLF (no 
TLF: prestent maxLCBI4mm 435 [253, 609]; TLF: prestent 
maxLCBI4mm 547 [412, 750]; P=0.12). Similarly, 
the change in lipid content before and after stenting 

was not associated with TLF during follow-up (no TLF: 
.maxLCBI 264 [127, 438]; TLF: .maxLCBI 225

4mm 4mm 

[211, 316]; P=0.8658). 

By IVUS, the MSA in the stented segment was numerically 
lower for lesions with (5.5±2.0 mm2) compared to 
without (6.5±2.3 mm2) TLF during follow-up, but the 
study failed to find statistical significance (P=0.099). 
Relative stent expansion was not significantly different 
among cases with and without TLF during followup, 
regardless of whether relative stent expansion was 
measured against the average MLA of the proximal and 
distal reference segments or against the MLA of the distal 
reference segment (Table 2). A proximal stent edge 
dissection was evident at baseline in 1.6% of treated 
target lesions without TLF during follow-up and in none 
of the treated target lesions with TLF (P=1.0). A distal 
stent edge dissection was present at baseline in 3.3% 
of treated target lesions without TLF and in none of the 
treated target lesions with TLF (P=1.0). No significant 
differences in plaque burden or plaque volume in the 
stent margins were observed among lesions with and 
without subsequent TLF (Table 3). The only baseline 
IVUS finding associated with TLF during follow-up was 
MLA in the distal stent margin, which was significantly 
smaller among lesions with (4.6 [4.0, 6.4] mm2) compared 
with lesions without (6.3 [4.9, 8.2] mm2) subsequent 
TLF (P=0.04).

Based on the results of the univariate analysis, the following 
variables met criteria and were included in the multivariate 
logistic regression model: use of drug-eluting stent 
or bare-metal stent; maxLCBI4mm in the stented segment; 
and MSA in the stented segment. By multivariate logistic 
regression analysis, residual maxLCBI4mm in the stented 
segment was the only variable independently associated 
with subsequent TLF (odds ratio, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.2–2.1] 
for every 100-unit increase, P=0.004; Figure 2; Table 3). 

Residual MaxLCBI4mm Threshold for TLF 

By receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the baseline 
residual maxLCBI4mm in the stented segment differentiated 
lesions with and without subsequent TLF with a 
C statistic of 0.71 (Figure 3). The optimal residual maxLCBI4mm 
threshold in the stented segment for identifying 
TLF was 200 and was characterized by a sensitivity of 
81.2% and specificity of 64.6%. The rate of TLF during 
follow-up was 15.0% among stented lesions with 
a baseline residual maxLCBI4mm >200 and was 3.1% 
among stented lesions with a residual maxLCBI4mm 
=200 (P=0.002). Kaplan-Meier curves for stented target 
lesions with and without a residual maxLCBI4mm >200 in 
the stented segment at baseline are shown in Figure 4. 

DISCUSSION 

The principal finding of the present study is that lipid 
content detected by NIRS in the stented segment after 
PCI was associated with TLF during follow-up. This was 
evident both in the univariate analysis, in which stented 
target lesions that developed TLF had a nearly 3-fold 
greater retained lipid content compared to lesions without 
TLF, and in the multivariate analysis, in which the baseline 
maxLCBI4mm in the stented segment was the only variable 
independently associated with TLF. In the multivariate 
analysis, higher quantities of retained lipid were associated 
with a higher risk of TLF, as each 100-unit increase 
in the maxLCBI4mm in the stented segment at baseline was 
associated with a 1.6-fold increase in the odds of developing 
TLF. By receiver-operating characteristic analysis, 
a post-PCI maxLCBI4mm of >200 in the stented segment 
was the optimal threshold for differentiating stented target 
lesions that did and did not develop subsequent TLF. 
Stented target lesions with a retained lipid content above 
this threshold had a nearly 5-fold higher TLF event rate 
than was observed among lesions with a retained lipid content 
below this threshold. These observations should only 
be considered hypothesis-generating due to the observational 
nature of the study. However, whereas multiple

prior studies have demonstrated that intracoronary LRP 
at nonstented sites are associated with future cardiovascular 
events,13,14,17 the present observations suggest that 
retained LRP may continue to be associated with adverse 
cardiovascular events even after treatment with stenting. 

LRP Underlying a Stent: Insights From Prior 
Studies 

Whereas autopsy studies have convincingly linked the 
rupture and thrombosis of LRP with the occurrence of 
myocardial infarction,1 some postmortem observations 
have also suggested that LRP might continue to influence 
cardiovascular outcomes even after being treated 
with PCI. Joner et al18 suggested penetration of a stent

strut into a necrotic core as a mechanism for late stent 
thrombosis and proposed that LRP underlying a stent 
could conceivably alter drug distribution and retention. 
Nakano et al19 demonstrated that both prolapse of a 
necrotic lipid core and the size of a lipid core underlying 
a stent were independently associated with early stent 
thrombosis. Consistent with these postmortem observations, 
irregular tissue protrusion visualized by optical 
coherence tomography (OCT), a finding proposed to represent 
the OCT correlate of stent strut penetration into 
LRP, has been shown to be independently associated 
with device-oriented clinical events during follow-up.20 

Consistent with these prior observations, the present 
study observed lipid content detected by NIRS in the 
treated lesion immediately after stenting was associated 
with an increased risk of subsequent TLF. Importantly, 
NIRS imaging in this study was performed on all patients 
after the PCI was completed and thereby identified the 
presence or absence of retained lipid in the target lesion 
post-PCI. A recent study of pre-PCI NIRS imaging demonstrated 
the lipid content of culprit lesions identified 
before PCI was not associated with subsequent culpritlesion 
events during 2 years of follow-up.21 Consistent 
with this finding, we did not observe pre-PCI NIRS findings 
to be associated with subsequent TLF. Hence, the 
risk of TLF after stenting may not relate to the lipid content 
of the target lesion before PCI, but rather only to the 
lipid that remains after PCI is performed. 

IVUS Findings and TLF 

Prior IVUS studies have demonstrated the degree of 
stent expansion and suboptimal findings at the stent 
edges, including a large plaque burden or edge dissections, 
are major determinants of stent thrombosis and 
restenosis risk.22,23 That IVUS findings of MSA, relative 
stent expansion, plaque burden in the stent margins, and 
stent edge dissections were not significantly associated 
TLF in the present study is likely a manifestation of the 
small sample size and small absolute number of TLF 
events. In this regard, MSA was numerically lower among 
lesions that had TLF compared with those that did not, 
but study failed to find statistical significance which may 
be due to insufficient sample size. The lack of an association 
between stent edge dissections and TLF in the 

Figure 2. Retained lipid in the stented segment and subsequent target lesion failure (TLF). 

In this study, the maximum lipid core burden index in 4 mm (maxLCBI4mm) detected by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in the stented segment 
after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was the only variable independently associated with TLF during follow-up. Each 100-unit increase 
in the maxLCBI4mm in the stented segment at baseline was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in the odds of developing TLF during follow-up. 
Shown is a representative case of a patient with a large lipid core detected by NIRS on pre-PCI images (top) and a large amount of retained 
lipid with a high maxLCBI4mm in the stented segment post-PCI (bottom). This patient developed TLF 131 d after the index PCI. 

present study may also be attributable to the low overall 
rate of observed edge dissections. In contrast to the 
small sample size and low rates of edge dissections of 
the present study, the Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet 
Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents sub-study, which demonstrated 
an association between IVUS-detected edge 
dissections and subsequent target lesion revascularization, 
included >2400 lesions and observed untreated 
stent edge dissections in nearly 8% of patients.22 

LRP in the Stent Margins: Does it Matter? 

Two prior observational studies indicated that NIRSdetected 
LRP commonly extends beyond the angiographic 
margins of the target lesion.24,25 Based on these 
observations, it was previously suggested that NIRS 
might have implications on stent length selection to 
ensure adequate coverage of all lipid in and adjacent to 
the target lesion. However, no association was observed 
between lipid content detected by NIRS in the stent 
margins and the risk of subsequent TLF. The lack of 
association between NIRS-detected LRP in the stent 
margins and subsequent TLF is seemingly inconsistent 
with the findings of Ino et al26 linking OCT-detected 
LRP in the stent margins with the risk of angiographic 
binary restenosis at the stent edge. Several factors may 
explain this discrepancy, including the concept that NIRS 
and OCT findings indicating the presence of lipid are 
often not congruent and may not be interchangeable.27 

Furthermore, the study by Ino et al26 demonstrated the 
risk of binary edge restenosis was dependent on lipid

OCT were associated with significantly higher rates of 
restenosis. In the present study, large LRP were rarely 
observed by NIRS in the stent margins. Rather, the NIRS 
findings in the stent margins among patients in the present 
study indicated the presence of relatively small lipid 
cores. Whether larger LRP detected by NIRS in the stent 
margins will associate with a higher risk of subsequent 
TLF remains unknown. Taken collectively, the present 
observations with NIRS and those of the prior OCT study 
seem to suggest that small amounts of lipid in the stent 
margins do not carry a substantial risk of TLF and angiographic 
restenosis, respectively. 

Limitations 

This study is limited by its small sample size, single-center 
observational study design, and the occurrence of 
relatively few events during follow-up. The use of baremetal 
stents in 26% of target lesions represents another 
limitation. In this study, bare-metal stents were associated 
with TLF in the univariate analysis. This observation 
may be attributable to the higher rate of restenosis 
characteristic of bare-metal stents and the hypothesis 
that newer-generation drug-eluting stents may be less 
thrombogenic than bare-metal stents. The higher rate of 
TLF among bare-metal stents in the univariate analysis 
is seemingly consistent with prior evidence demonstrating 
bare-metal stents to be associated with higher rates 
of target vessel revascularization, as well as myocardial 
infarction and definite stent thrombosis, compared 
to newer-generation drug-eluting stents.28 Despite the 
high rate of bare-metal stent usage in the present study, 
stent type was not associated with TLF by multivariate 
analysis. Whether the present findings will extend to a 
population treated only with drug-eluting stents remains

uncertain. Whereas NIRS findings in untreated coronary 
arteries have been extensively validated against the gold 
standard of histology,10,11 NIRS findings in stented segments 
have not been similarly validated. Furthermore, we 
cannot exclude the possibility that operators may have 
selected longer stent lengths based on the NIRS findings 
to adequately cover all substantial lipid cores, thereby 
impacting the ability to detect an association between 
large lipid content in the stent margins and subsequent 
TLF. Finally, quantitative evaluations of edge dissections, 
including measurement of dissection angle and dissection 
length, were not performed. Although this may be 
viewed as a limitation, a large prior study demonstrated 
that length and angle of edge dissections detected by 
IVUS were not significantly different between lesions 
with and without target lesion revascularization.22 

Conclusions 

Lipid content detected by NIRS in the stented segment 
after PCI was associated with an increased risk of 
TLF during follow-up. Whereas prior studies have demonstrated 
intracoronary LRP at nonstented sites to be 
associated with future cardiovascular events, the present 
observations suggest that retained lipid in the stented 
segment may similarly be associated with adverse 
events. These findings require confirmation in a larger 
series of patients.
