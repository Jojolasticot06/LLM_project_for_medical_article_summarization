Introduction 
Diabetes can lead to a vast spectrum of systemic complications
including central and peripheral neurodegeneration
[1, 2]. Techniques that allow early detection and regular
follow-up of hyperglycaemia-induced neurodegeneration
are thus of major importance.
As postulated in the ‘ticking clock hypothesis’, hyperglycaemia-
mediated damage is a continuous (i.e. linear)

process that starts before the onset of type 2 diabetes [3, 4]. 
Indeed, we have previously demonstrated linear associations 
of adverse glucose metabolism status and higher levels of 
glycaemic measures with lower retinal nerve fibre layer thickness 
[5], more brain structural abnormalities [6, 7], worse 
peripheral nerve function [8] and lower heart rate variability 
[9], which are all measures of neurodegeneration and/ 
or neural dysfunction. Additionally, chronic hyperglycaemia 
accelerates the formation of advanced glycation end-products 
(AGEs), which are considered a major initiator of neurodegeneration 
[10]. AGEs are protein-bound compounds that 
exhibit intrinsic fluorescence properties, which can be measured 
non-invasively as skin autofluorescence (SAF) [11]. We 
have shown previously that AGEs assessed as SAF are associated 
with lower retinal nerve fibre layer thickness [5], more brain structural abnormalities [6, 7], worse
peripheral nerve function [8] and lower heart rate variability
[9], which are all measures of neurodegeneration and/
or neural dysfunction. Additionally, chronic hyperglycaemia
accelerates the formation of advanced glycation end-products
(AGEs), which are considered a major initiator of neurodegeneration
[10]. AGEs are protein-bound compounds that
exhibit intrinsic fluorescence properties, which can be measured
non-invasively as skin autofluorescence (SAF) [11]. We
have shown previously that AGEs assessed as SAF are associated
with lower retinal nerve fibre layer thickness [5].

Various instruments and techniques are currently available 
to allow scientists to monitor central and peripheral nervous 
system activity. However, these methods are often timeconsuming 
and have relatively high costs [12, 13], making 
them impractical for routine and large-scale use. There thus is 
a need for a sensitive and practical method that allows detection 
of early hyperglycaemia-mediated neurodegeneration. 

Here we focus on hyperglycaemia as a determinant of 
morphological changes in small nerve fibres (unmyelinated 
C-fibres) assessed by corneal confocal microscopy, an 
in vivo, non-invasive and sensitive measure [14] to assess 
corneal nerve degeneration. The current literature supports 
the concept that hyperglycaemia affects corneal nerve fibres 
[15], and that corneal confocal microscopy may be used as a 

tool to identify peripheral [15, 16] and central neurodegeneration 
[16]. Moreover, studies have suggested that alterations 
in corneal nerves morphology may serve as an early indicator 
of diabetic neuropathy, offering a potential opportunity 
for timely diagnosis and treatment [17, 18]. However, these 
studies had several important limitations. Specifically, previous 
studies were not population-based, did not adjust for 
cardiovascular risk and lifestyle factors, and did not investigate 
whether various measures of glycaemia are linearly 
associated with measures of corneal nerve fibre damage. 

Hence, we investigated, in a large, well-characterised 
population-based cohort study, whether a more adverse 
glucose metabolism status and higher measures of glycaemia 
are associated with neurodegeneration assessed 
using measures of corneal nerve fibre damage, i.e. lower 
corneal nerve bifurcation density, corneal nerve density, 
corneal nerve length and fractal dimension, as measured 
by corneal confocal microscopy. 

Methods 

Study population and design 

We used data from the Maastricht Study, an observational 
prospective population-based cohort study enriched with 
type 2 diabetes individuals. Individuals with type 2 diabetes 
were over-sampled for efficiency reasons, i.e. to increase the 
statistical power to identify any potential contrasts between 

individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. The rationale 
and methodology have been described previously [19]. In 
brief, the study focuses on the aetiology, pathophysiology, 
complications and comorbidities of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 
and is characterised by an extensive phenotyping approach. 
Eligible for participation were all individuals aged between 
40 and 75 years living in the southern part of the Netherlands. 
Participants were recruited through mass media campaigns 
and from the municipal registries and the regional Diabetes 
Patient Registry via mailings. Recruitment was stratified 
according to known type 2 diabetes status [19]. The present 
report includes cross-sectional data for N=3471 participants 
who completed the baseline survey between November 2010 
and December 2017. The examinations for each participant 
were performed within a time window of 3 months. Corneal 
confocal microscopy measurements were performed 
between April 2013 and January 2017. Individuals who participated 
in the Maastricht Study before the start of corneal 
confocal microscopy measurement (i.e. before April 2013) 
were re-invited (n=974) (‘catch-up visit’). For these participants, 
there was a median time interval (‘visit interval or 
lag time’) of 5.2 years between corneal confocal microscopy 
measurements and all other measurements. The study has 
been approved by the institutional medical ethical committee 
(NL31329.068.10) and the Minister of Health, Welfare and 
Sports of the Netherlands (permit 131088–105234-PG). All 
participants gave written informed consent [19]. 

Assessment of corneal confocal microscopy 
measurements (outcome) 

We used corneal confocal microscopy using a Heidelberg 
retina tomograph III (HRT3), Rostock cornea module (Heidelberg 
Engineering, Germany) to image corneal nerves 

[14] of the left eye only for logistical reasons. Before the 
measurement, we anaesthetised both eyes using oxybuprocaine 
hydrochloride 0.4 mg/ml eye drops (Minims; Bausch & 
Lomb, France) to eliminate all causes of blinking, and wetted 
both eyes using carbomer 2 mg/g eye gel (Vidsic Bausch & 
Lomb) to ensure optimal contact between the cornea and the 
applanation cap. Further methodological details are provided 
in the electronic supplementary material (ESM) Methods. 
Individuals who had a corneal transplant or had a corneal 
infection of the left eye were excluded from the measurements. 
Participants were instructed to fix their vision on a 
white light throughout the scan. Trained research assistants 
imaged the sub-basal nerve plexus layer in the central part 
of the cornea according to a standard operating procedure. 
We assessed multiple recordings of 400×400 µm (384×384 
pixels, 8-bit) assembled using a composite algorithm implemented 
in the HRT3 user interface (Heidelberg Engineering), 
as previously described [14]. Real-time mapping was 
performed on an area up to 1600×1600 µm (1536×1536 

pixels, 8-bit) that partially included the inferior whorl in 
some of the composite images. No measures were taken to 
include or exclude this region. The advantage of performing 
large scale corneal confocal microscopy imaging (1600 × 
1600 µm) is described in the ESM Methods. 

We used the U-net-based convolutional neural network to 
fully automatically trace the corneal nerves [20] (ESM Fig. 1) 
and analysed the following indices: corneal nerve bifurcation 
density (number of bifurcation points [branching points] per 
mm2), corneal nerve density (total number of corneal nerve 
fibres [including both main fibres and branches] per mm , 
with ‘main nerve fibres’ referring to the largest and most 
prominent nerve fibres), corneal nerve length (total length 
of corneal nerve fibres in mm, both main and branches, per 
mm2) and corneal nerve fractal dimension (quantification of 
the nerve structure complexity). Composite segmented images 
were reviewed manually, and images were considered to be 
usable (n=3623) if 50% or more of the total captured area was 
of good quality (see ESM Methods for more details). ESM 
Fig. 2 provides examples of included and excluded images. 
We also assessed the location of the captured images based on 
the orientation of the corneal nerves (ESM Fig. 3). The intraclass 
and inter-observer correlation coefficients, both indices 
of reliability, were = 0.97 and = 0.89, respectively [21]. 

Assessment of determinants 

Glucose metabolism status After an overnight fast, participants 
underwent a standardised seven-point OGTT, as part 
of which venous samples were collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 
and 120 min post-ingestion of a 75 g glucose drink. All participants 
underwent an OGTT except those who used insulin 
or had a fasting plasma glucose concentration above 11.0 
mmol/l. Based on fasting plasma glucose and 2 h post-load 
glucose, glucose metabolism status was determined as normal 
glucose metabolism, prediabetes (defined as impaired 
fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance or both), type 2 
diabetes or other types of diabetes (including type 1 diabetes) 
according to the WHO 2006 criteria [22] 

Measures of glycaemia Fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l) and 
HbA1c (mmol/mol, %) were determined in venous plasma 
samples collected after an overnight fast. The value for 2 h 
post-load glucose (mmol/l) was determined in venous plasma 
collected at 120 min after ingestion of the glucose drink. 
The levels of AGEs in the skin were assessed using an AGE 
Reader (DiagnOptics Technologies, the Netherlands). In 
brief, the AGE Reader is a desktop device that uses the characteristic 
fluorescent properties of certain AGEs to quantify 
their accumulation in the skin as SAF (arbitrary units) [23]. 
The AGE Reader illuminates a skin surface of 4 cm2, shielded 
from other light, and uses the ratio of the reflection of fluorescent 
light (wavelength 420–600 nm) to non-fluorescent light 

(300–420 nm) to calculate SAF (see ESM Methods for more 
details). The duration of diabetes in individuals with type 2 
diabetes was assessed using a questionnaire. 

Covariates 

As described previously [19], we assessed educational level 
(low, intermediate, high), socioeconomic status (income level 
and occupational status) [24], smoking status (never, former, 
current), alcohol use (none, low, high), history of ocular 
disorders (corneal diseases or uveitis), and use of contact 
lenses by questionnaire, assessed the presence of retinopathy 
in both eyes via fundus photography (see ESM Methods for 
more details), assessed dietary habits (‘dietary intake’) using 
the Dutch Healthy Diet index sum score, which is a measure 
of adherence to the Dutch dietary guidelines 2015 (see ESM 
Methods for more details) [25], based on a validated food frequency 
questionnaire [26], assessed use of lipid-modifying, 
antihypertensive and glucose-lowering medication as part of 
a medication interview, assessed weight (kg), height (cm) and 
waist circumference (cm) during a physical examination, calculated 
BMI (kg/m2) based on body weight and height, measured 
office and 24 h ambulatory BP (mmHg), measured total daily 
physical activity (h/day) using an accelerometer [27], measured 
lipid profile and plasma biomarkers of low-grade inflammation 

[28] (i.e. high-sensitive C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, 
IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-a) in fasting venous blood samples, measured 
urinary albumin excretion in two 24 h urine collections, 
calculated the eGFR based on serum creatinine only, as values 
for cystatin C were not available for all study participants, and 
assessed sensory neuropathy as having neuropathic pain using 
the Dutch version of the DN4 interview [29], via impaired uni-
or bilateral vibration perception, measured three times using a 
Horwell neurothesiometer (Scientific Laboratory Supplies, UK) 
at the distal phalanx of the hallux of the right and left foot [19], 
and/or on the basis of use of medication prescribed for neuropathic 
pain (gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, amitriptyline, 
nortriptyline or carbamazepine, the latter only in individuals 
without a diagnosis of epilepsy). 
Statistical analyses 

Population characteristics and measures of the corneal nerves 
were described for the total study population and by tertiles of 
unweighted composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre measures 
using the appropriate descriptive statistics (Table 1). Before we 
calculated the composite Z-score, we checked whether associations 
of potential determinants with the individual corneal 
nerve fibre measures were not directionally different, and this 
was the case. Additional general study population characteristics 
and general study population characteristics of the included and 
excluded participants are provided in ESM Table 1 and ESM 
Table 2. All analyses were performed using Statistical Package 

for Social Sciences version 25.0 (IBM SPSS, USA). For all analyses, 
a p 
value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 

Main analyses We used multivariable linear regression 
analyses to investigate the associations of determinants (i.e. 
glucose metabolism status [entered as dummy variables for 
prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, or other types of diabetes vs 
normal glucose metabolism] and measures of glycaemia 
[standardised fasting plasma glucose, 2 h post-load glucose, 
HbA1c, SAF and duration of diabetes]) with outcomes (i.e. 
composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre measures [main 
outcome] and standardised corneal nerve fibre measures [i.e. 
corneal nerve bifurcation density, corneal nerve density, corneal 
nerve length and corneal nerve fractal dimension]). 

We performed an analysis of the linear trend for the association 
with glucose metabolism status as a determinant. To estimate 
the linear trend, we entered glucose metabolism status into 
the model as an ordinal variable (i.e. glucose metabolism status 
was coded as normal glucose metabolism = 0, prediabetes = 
1, type 2 diabetes = 2). In a p for trend analysis, we excluded 
participants with other types of diabetes (such as type 1 diabetes) 
because other types of diabetes do not constitute part of the 
spectrum of deterioration of glucose metabolism status from 
normal glucose metabolism to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. 
Then, we checked whether we could assume a linear trend 
by comparing the statistical variance explained by the statistical 
model in which glucose metabolism status was entered as 
dummy variables to that obtained using the statistical model 
in which glucose metabolism status was entered as an ordinal 
variable. We used a likelihood ratio test to assess whether the 
difference in the amount of variance explained by both models 
was statistically significant. A p value > 0.05 indicates that both 
models are not different, and thus a linear trend can be assumed. 

We used several sets of adjustments. Model 1 shows crude 
results adjusted for corneal confocal microscopy lag time. 
Model 2, in addition to the adjustment in model 1, was adjusted 
for age, sex and educational status (high, medium, low). We 
chose these variables because they are key potential confounders. 
Model 3, in addition to the adjustments in model 2, was 
adjusted for office systolic BP, use of antihypertensive medication 
(yes/no), waist circumference, total cholesterol to HDLcholesterol 
ratio, use of lipid-modifying medication (yes/no), 
smoking status (never, former, current) and alcohol consumption 
status (none, low [for women, =7 alcohol units per day; for 
men, =14 alcohol units per day], high [for women, >7 alcohol 
units per day; for men, >14 alcohol units per day]). Biologically, 
these risk factors may be associated with hyperglycaemia 
and corneal neurodegeneration. All associations are expressed 
as standardised regression coefficients and the corresponding 
95% CI. To facilitate interpretation, we show unstandardised 
regression coefficients (ß) in ESM Table 3. The associations 
between glucose metabolism status and measures of glycaemia 
with corneal nerve fractal dimension had long strings of digits,

Results 

Selection and characteristics of the study 
population 

Figure 1 shows an overview of selection of the study 
population. 

Table 1 and ESM Table 1 show the general participant characteristics 
according to tertiles of composite Z-score for corneal 
nerve fibre measures. Overall, participants with a lower 
composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre measures were older 
and had a more adverse cardiovascular risk profile. The general 
characteristics of participants included in the study were comparable 
to those with missing data (ESM Table 2). 

Fig. 1 Selection of participants 
for inclusion in analyses 

Glucose metabolism status and corneal nerve fibre 
measures 

According to model 3, a more adverse glucose metabolism 
status was associated with a lower composite Z-score for 
corneal nerve fibre measures (ß [95% CI]: type 2 diabetes 
vs normal glucose metabolism -0.14 [-0.25, -0.04], prediabetes 
vs normal glucose metabolism -0.08 [-0.17, 0.03]; 
linear trend analysis showed a p value of 0.001) (Table 2 
and Fig. 2). In general, directionally similar associations 
were observed for individual corneal nerve fibre measures 
(Table 2). 

Measures of glycaemia and corneal nerve fibre 
measures 

According to model 3, higher levels of measures of glycaemia 
(fasting plasma glucose, 2 h post-load glucose, HbA1c, 
SAF and duration of diabetes) were all significantly associated 
with a lower composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre 
measures (per SD: -0.09 [-0.13, -0.05], -0.07 [-0.11, 
-0.03], -0.08 [-0.11, -0.04], -0.05 [-0.08, -0.01], -0.09 
[-0.17, -0.001], respectively) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). In general, 
directionally similar associations were observed for 
individual corneal nerve fibre measures (Table 2).

Interaction analyses 

Sex modified the association of prediabetes vs normal glucose 
metabolism and composite Z-score for corneal nerve 
fibre measures (p value for the interaction term prediabetes 
× sex = 0.01). In women, but not in men, we found a 
significant association of prediabetes vs normal glucose 
metabolism with the composite Z-score for corneal nerve 
fibre measures (-0.18 [-0.33, -0.04] in women and 0.04 
[-0.10, 0.19] in men). Stratified analyses for all associations 
are shown in ESM Table 4. However, the sex interaction 
stratified analyses did not consistently demonstrate significant 
sex differences in the associations between (pre)diabetes, 
measures of glycaemia and corneal nerve measures.

Discussion 

The present population-based observational study had the 
following main findings. First, after adjustment for a range 
of potential confounders, a more adverse glucose metabolism 
status and higher levels of glycaemic measures (fasting 
plasma glucose, 2 h post-load glucose, HbA1c, SAF and 
duration of diabetes) were all linearly associated with a 
lower composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre measures. 
Second, associations were linear across glucose metabolism 
categories, implying that glycaemia-associated corneal nerve 
damage starts well before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Third, 
to put our findings into perspective, the ß coefficients for prediabetes 
and type 2 diabetes correspond to 10 and 17 years 
of additional ageing, respectively (ESM Table 13). 

To our knowledge, our study is the first large populationbased 
study that investigated glycaemia-associated corneal 
nerve damage across glucose metabolism categories with 
adjustment for an extensive set of potential confounders. Our 

results are in line with observations from previous research 
[21, 31–40]. Novel associations that this study reports are 
the associations of 2 h post-load glucose and SAF with corneal 
nerve indices. In addition, the present study is, to our 
knowledge, the first to demonstrate that fasting plasma glucose, 
2 h post-load glucose, SAF and duration of diabetes are 
all linearly associated with corneal nerve indices. 

Our findings imply that the process of glycaemia-induced 
corneal neurodegeneration starts well before the onset of 
type 2 diabetes. Thus, these findings are in line with the 
‘ticking clock hypothesis’ [5–9], which states that glycaemia-
induced microvascular and neuronal deterioration is a 
continuous process that starts long before the onset of type 2 
diabetes and gradually worsens during prediabetes and early 
and advanced type 2 diabetes [4]. Our results show a gradual 
decrease in the composite Z-score for corneal neurodegeneration 
from the reference group (with normal glucose 
metabolism) to prediabetes and towards type 2 diabetes, 
which is directionally comparable to previous findings on 
retinal nerve fibre layer thickness [5], brain structural abnormalities 
[6, 7], peripheral nerve function [8] and heart rate 
variability [9], which are all measures of neurodegeneration 
and/or neural dysfunction. 

Additionally, our findings suggest that AGEs may be 
implicated in the pathobiology of corneal neurodegeneration. 
Indeed, we demonstrated that SAF, which reflects the 
accumulation of AGEs in the skin, was significantly associated 
with a lower composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre 
measures even after adjustment for fasting plasma glucose, 
2 h post-load glucose or HbA1c (ESM Table 11). 

We used a composite score (i.e. composite Z-score for 
corneal nerve fibre measures) to determine corneal neurodegeneration. 
The advantage of this approach is that the 
influence of the technical or biological variability is reduced 

[41] provided that the associations between the key exposure 
(here glucose) and all elements of the Z-score are directionally 
similar, which is the case here: when we investigated 
the associations between glucose metabolism status and 
measures of glycaemia with the corneal nerve fibre measures 
individually (corneal nerve bifurcation density, corneal 
nerve density, corneal nerve length and fractal dimension), 
we found directionally similar associations (Table 2). 
Note that the corneal nerve measures in our study population 
differ from those in other studies [42], possibly because 

(1) we assessed the corneal nerve variables in larger images, 
with an area up to 1600×1600 µm, and therefore partially 
including the inferior whorl in some of the composite images, 
which is characterised by a different architecture, distribution 
and density of the corneal nerve fibres [43], (2) we used a different 
deep learning model (U-Net-based convolutional neural 
network) to fully automatically trace and analyse the indices 
of corneal nerves [44], and (3) the corneal nerve density 
and length were also defined differently from other studies 
(total number and length of corneal nerves, both main and 
branches, per mm2). However, these outcomes were assessed 
in all sub-groups of participants and therefore the differences 
do not detract from the consistency of our findings. 

Although the association between prediabetes and a lower 
composite Z-score for corneal nerve measures, in model 3, 
was not significant when compared with normal glucose 
metabolism, this is probably due to insufficient statistical 
power. Therefore, we tested the linear trend with glucose 
metabolism status deterioration, using the statistically more 
powerful p value to estimate the linear trend, and observed 
that a more adverse glucose metabolism status was consistently 
associated with a linear decrease in the composite 
Z-score for corneal nerve fibre measures. These associations 
are consistent with our findings that showed linear associations 
of continuous glycaemia measures with corneal nerve 
fibres (Table 2). 

Our findings may have implications for clinical practice. 
First, early glycaemic control, before the onset of type 2 diabetes, 
is likely to be important in prevention of early neurodegeneration. 
Second, because corneal neurodegeneration 
may be a biomarker for diabetic neuropathy [45], detection 
of early stages of neuropathy is relatively inexpensive and 
easy to perform. 

Our study had several strengths. First, it is, to our knowledge, 
the first large population-based observational study 
with oversampling of individuals with type 2 diabetes that 
studied the associations between (pre)diabetes and measures 
of glycaemia with corneal neurodegeneration. Second, we 
adjusted for a large series of potential confounders. Finally, 
additional analyses generally yielded consistent findings. 

We suggest that the composite Z-score for corneal nerve 
measures may be a potential predictor for neuropathy, inde-
pendent of glucose metabolism status. Our results showed 
numerically similar correlation coefficients for individuals in 
all glucose metabolism strata, although the smaller sample 
size of individual groups led to lower statistical power than 
for the main study population. In addition, we performed an 
additional analysis observing the associations of prediabetes 
and type 2 diabetes vs normal glucose metabolism with the 
composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre measures after 
exclusion of participants with sensory neuropathy. After 
adjustment (model 3), a more adverse glucose metabolism 
status was associated with a lower composite Z-score for 
corneal nerve fibre measures (ß [95% CI]: type 2 diabetes vs 
normal glucose metabolism -0.16 [-0.27, -0.04], prediabetes 
vs normal glucose metabolism -0.08 [-0.19, 0.03]) 
(data not shown). These associations suggest that corneal 
neurodegeneration starts before the development of clinical 
sensory neuropathy. 

Our study also had limitations. First, because of the 
observational cross-sectional nature of the study, any causal 
inferences should be made with caution. Nevertheless, 
reverse causation appears unlikely, and we adjusted for many 
potential confounders. Second, underestimation of the association 
of prediabetes vs normal glucose metabolism with 
composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre measures may 
have occurred due to misclassification of individuals with 
prediabetes, as the classification was based on one OGTT 
only. Third, we may have underestimated associations due 
to range restriction for analyses involving 2 h post-load glucose, 
as individuals who used insulin or had a fasting plasma 
glucose concentration above 11.0 mmol/l did not undergo 
an OGTT. Fourth, even though we considered an extensive 
number of confounders, we cannot fully exclude bias due 
to unmeasured confounding, for example by environmental 
factors such as air pollution. Fifth, because corneal con-
focal microscopy measurements started from April 2013, 
individuals who participated in the Maastricht Study before 
the start of corneal confocal microscopy measurement (i.e. 
before April 2013; n=974; 28.1%) had a median visit inter-
val of 5.2 years (IQR 4.9–5.8). However, to provide a more 
appropriate estimate of the true association, we adjusted for 
visit interval in model 1 for all associations. We also analysed 
potential interaction with visit interval. We added an 
interaction term (i.e. fasting plasma glucose × visit inter-
val) [30] to model 3 (data not shown). The interval did not 
modify the association between fasting plasma glucose and 
composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre measures (p value 
of the interaction term fasting plasma glucose × visit interval 
= 0.16). We also performed additional analyses in which 
we excluded participants with a catch-up visit to assess the 
association between fasting plasma glucose and Z-score for 
corneal nerve fibre measures. Similar results were observed 
(data not shown). Finally, this study comprised individuals 
of European descent aged between 40 and 75 years old 
with access to high-quality diabetes care. Therefore, further 
study is required to determine whether our results may be 
generalised to other populations. 

Conclusions 

In summary, the present population-based study demonstrated 
that a more adverse glucose metabolism status and a 
higher level of glycaemic measures are continuously associated 
with lower composite Z-score for corneal nerve fibre 
measures. These associations were independent of demographics, 
cardiovascular or lifestyle risk factors. Hence, our 
results indicate that glycaemia-associated morphological 
changes in the corneal nerves may be an early process that 
starts well before the onset of type 2 diabetes. Whether early 
intervention to reduce hyperglycaemia can prevent corneal 
neurodegeneration requires further study.
