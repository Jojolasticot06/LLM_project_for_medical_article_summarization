Moderate alcohol consumption is widespread but its impact on brain structure and 
function is contentious. The relationship between alcohol intake and structural 
and functional neuroimaging indices, the threshold intake for associations, and 
whether population subgroups are at higher risk of alcohol-related brain harm 
remain unclear. 25,378 UK Biobank participants (mean age 54.9 ± 7.4 years, 
12,254 female) underwent multi-modal MRI 9.6 ± 1.1 years after study baseline. 
Alcohol use was self-reported at baseline (2006-10). T1-weighted, diffusion 
weighted and resting state images were examined. Lower total grey matter volumes 
were observed in those drinking as little as 7-14 units (56-112 g) weekly. 
Higher alcohol consumption was associated with multiple markers of white matter 
microstructure, including lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean and radial 
diffusivity in a spatially distributed pattern across the brain. Associations 
between functional connectivity and alcohol intake were observed in the default 
mode, central executive, attention, salience and visual resting state networks. 
Relationships between total grey matter and alcohol were stronger than other 
modifiable factors, including blood pressure and smoking, and robust to 
unobserved confounding. Frequent binging, higher blood pressure and BMI 
steepened the negative association between alcohol and total grey matter volume. 
In this large observational cohort study, alcohol consumption was associated 
with multiple structural and functional MRI markers in mid- to late-life.
