OBJECTIVES: The benefit of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in 
reducing the occurrence rate of adverse cardiac and renal outcomes in patients 
with type 2 diabetes has been well described in randomized trials. Whether this 
benefit extends to patients at the most severe end of the disease spectrum 
requiring admission to the ICU remains to be examined.
DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
SETTING: Data were obtained from a territory-wide clinical registry in Hong Kong 
(Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System).
PATIENTS: All adult patients (age ≥ 18 yr) with type 2 diabetes and newly 
prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors between 
January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2019.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 1:2 propensity score matching, a total of 
27,972 patients (10,308 SGLT2 inhibitors vs 17,664 DPP-4 inhibitors) were 
included in the final analysis. The mean age was 59 ± 11 years, and 17,416 
(62.3%) were male. The median follow-up period was 2.9 years. The use of SGLT2 
inhibitors was associated with decreased ICU admission (286 [2.8%] vs 645 
[3.7%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.91; p = 0.001) and lower risks 
of all-cause mortality (315 [3.1%] vs 1,327 [7.5%]; HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.38-0.49; 
p < 0.001), compared with DPP-4 inhibitors. The severity of illness upon ICU 
admission by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IV-predicted risk of 
death was also lower in SGLT2 inhibitors users. Admissions and mortality due to 
sepsis were lower in SGLT2 inhibitor users compared with DPP-4 inhibitor users 
(admissions for sepsis: 45 [0.4%] vs 134 [0.8%]; p = 0.001 and mortality: 59 
[0.6%] vs 414 [2.3%]; p < 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT2 inhibitors were 
independently associated with lower rates of ICU admission and all-cause 
mortality across various disease categories.
