Progressive vision loss and neurocognitive impairment are early and frequent presentations in CLN3 disease. This highlights neurodevelopmental functioning as critical to the disease, but limits the neuropsychological test repertoire. We evaluated the convergent validity of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales as a potential outcome measure. In a prospective observational study of 22 individuals (female:male 11:11; 6-20â€‰years-old) with a molecular diagnosis of CLN3, we used generalized linear models and Spearman correlations to quantify the relationship of the adaptive behavior composite (ABC) standard score with established outcomes of verbal IQ (VIQ) and disease severity (Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale, UBDRS) scores. We analyzed ABC changes in 1-year follow-up data in a subset of the same cohort (n = 17). The ABC and VIQ, both standard scores, exhibited a strong positive correlation in cross-sectional data (r = 0.81). ABC and UBDRS scores were strongly and positively correlated in cross-sectional data (rrange = 0.87-0.93). Participants' ABC scores decreased slightly over the 1-year follow-up period (mean change, 95% CI: -5.23, -2.16). The convergent validity of the Vineland-3 for use in CLN3 is supported by its relationships with the established outcomes of VIQ and UBDRS. Future longitudinal research, including replication in other cohorts and evaluation of sensitivity to change, will be important to establish utility of the Vineland-3 for monitoring change in CLN3.
