Introduction 
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to 
threaten global health. Cough is a key symptom in the acute phase of 
COVID-19 and may persist in the postacute phase. It was present in 
approximately 60–70% of symptomatic patients infected with the wild 
strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
(Guan et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2020) and approximately 50% of 
symptomatic patients infected with the Delta and Omicron variants of 
SARS-CoV-2 (Ekroth et al., 2022; Menni et al., 2022). Cough increases 
the risk of community transmission through respiratory droplets (Dhand 
and Li, 2020) and can negatively impact quality of life (Ct et al., 2002), 
contributing to the stigma associated with COVID-19. Therefore, identifying 
ways to control cough could help to inhibit the spread of the 
disease and eliminate cough-related stigma. 
Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely utilized in 
China and has played an important role in the management of COVID- 
19, particularly in the alleviation of its associated symptoms (Du 
et al., 2021; Lyu et al., 2021). Studies have shown that TCM, such as 
Jinhua Qinggan (Shah et al., 2022) and Lianhua Qingwen (Hu et al., 
2021), could alleviate cough symptoms and reduce the number of cough 
cases (Du et al., 2021). Other Chinese herb medicine, such as almond has 
beneficial effects such as antitussive, antiasthmatic, and antibacterial 
activities (Wei et al., 2023; Mahdi et al., 2022). 
Kumquat (Fortunella margarita (Lour.) Swingle), a small citrus fruit 
native to China, has historical use in TCM in treating respiratory inflammatory 
syndromes, including cough and sore throat (Lin et al., 
2008). As the largest kumquat-producing region in China, Yangshuo 
County formulated a kumquat decoction to alleviate COVID-19-related 
cough after the termination of the “Dynamic Zero-COVID Strategy” in 
China in December 2022. Kumquat decoction consists of six edible 
TCMs, each of which has been widely used to for viral infections such as 
the common cold, fever, and influenza (Gao, 2015; Yu et al., 2018; 
Zhang et al., 2020, 2022). The decoction soon gained popularity in 
Yangshuo County, particularly in rural areas. However, there is still a 
lack of scientific evidence supporting its efficacy and safety in managing 
COVID-19-associated cough symptoms. 
To address this gap, a multicentre prospective observational study 
was conducted in five township hospitals in Yangshuo County to evaluate 
the potential value of kumquat decoction as a safe and effective 
natural remedy for managing cough symptoms in nonsevere COVID-19 
patients. By exploring the use of natural remedies like kumquat decoction 
in managing COVID-19 symptoms, it is possible to provide an 
accessible and cost-effective self-care option for patients who might not 
have access to medical care. 
Methods 
This was a multicentre prospective observational study in a real- 
world setting. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of 
Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (No. BE2022-340- 
01) and was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR2300067625). 
Informed consent was obtained from all the patients. 
Participants and setting 
The research was carried out at five township hospitals in Yangshuo 
County, namely, Yangshuo, Baisha, Fuli, Gaotian, and Puyi township 
hospitals. Consecutive outpatients with COVID-19 in the five hospitals 
were screened for eligibility from December 31, 2022, to January 3, 
2023. The cut-off date for follow-up was January 31, 2023. During the 
study phase, the predominant strain of COVID-19 was the Omicron 
variant. Cough severity was assessed using the Cough Evaluation Test 
(CET) as outlined in Table 1. This test was a 5-item questionnaire to 
simply evaluate cough severity and its impact on physical, social, and 
psychological health. The CET was demonstrated strong correlations 
with the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (r =-0.74) and Visual Analogue 
Scales (r =0.70), with Cronbach’s alpha values of 0.80 (Zhan et al., 
2020). Total scores on the 5-item scale ranged from 5 to 25, with a score 
of 5 indicating the absence of a cough. 
Eligible patients had mild or moderate COVID-19 and a total CET 
score greater than 5. COVID-19 was diagnosed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test or a 
rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen test. According to the Diagnosis and Treatment 
Guidelines for COVID-19 in China (Trial Version Ninth Edition), mild 
COVID-19 was defined as mild symptoms without any signs of viral 
pneumonia in chest computed tomography images. Moderate COVID-19 
referred to fever and respiratory symptoms with radiological manifestations 
of pneumonia but without any indications of hypoxemia. 
We excluded the following patients: (1) those who were allergic to 
any component of kumquat decoction; (2) those with a past diagnosis of 
chronic lung disease (including bronchiectasis, asthma, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic cough for more than 8 weeks, 
lung cancer, lung abscess, respiratory tract bacterial infection, etc.); (3) 
current or former heavy smokers, defined as a smoking index =400 
(Feng et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2011) (i.e., years of smoking multiplied 
by the number of cigarettes smoked per day =400); (4) those who were 
unable to complete regular follow-ups; (5) pregnant women; (6) those 
with severe comorbidities or acute onset of chronic disease (such as 
acute heart failure); and (7) those who had participated or were 
participating in other clinical trials within 1 month prior to this study. 
Assessment and follow-up 
COVID-19-related cough symptom scores were evaluated by the CET 
(Zhan et al., 2020) (Table 1, described above). Other symptoms were

assessed by a 13-item symptom score based on 13 common 
COVID-19-related symptoms as recommended by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA, 2020) for assessing COVID-19-related symptoms 
in clinical trials. The day of enrolment was set as Day 0. We developed a 
structured electronic questionnaire (Table 1 and Appendix A for symptom 
scores) and distributed it to patients via a QR code linked to the 
questionnaire to remind them to complete it truthfully. Patients were 
followed up daily during Days 0-7 and on January 31, 2023. For patients 
who still had cough symptoms on Day 7, two additional questions were 
added to inquire if their cough had resolved and the specific date of 
resolution on the final follow-up date of January 31, 2023. 
Data collection 
Demographic information, cough onset date, date of positive SARS- 
CoV-2 RT-PCR test or positive self-test for COVID-19 antigen, comorbidities, 
vaccination status, cough treatment prior to baseline, and TCM 
syndrome differentiation were collected at baseline (Day 0). Information 
on adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications was collected 
during the follow-up phase (Days 1-7 and final follow-up on January 31, 
2023), with AEs recorded only in the kumquat decoction group. CET and 
13-item COVID-19-related symptom questionnaire data were collected 
throughout the follow-up process. 
Study treatment 
The study cohort was divided into two groups: patients who received 
kumquat decoction (kumquat decoction group) and those who did not 
receive kumquat decoction (usual care group). Kumquat decoction use 
was defined as receiving this medication for no less than one day. 
The patients were diagnosed with a cold or heat cough based on TCM 
syndrome differentiation. Kumquat decoction comprised Kumquat (100 
g), Jiegeng (Platycodonis radix) (10 g), and two other Chinese herbs. For 
those with a cold cough, Chenpi (citri reticulatae pericarpium) (3 g) and 
Shengjiang (Zingiberis rhizoma recent) (20 g) were added. For those with 
a heat cough, Chinese water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) (50 g) and 
Beishashen (Glehniae radix) (10 g) were added. Kumquat decoction was 
taken orally in a single dose of 66 ml three times daily for five consecutive 
days. The composition, dosage, and principle of TCM diagnosis are 
listed in Supplementary Appendix B. 
In the usual care group, patients were treated according to the 
Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 in China (Trial Version 
9th Edition). They were given antitussive or other Chinese patent 
medicine to relieve cough. 
Outcomes 
The primary outcome was the time from study baseline to sustained 
cough resolution. Sustained cough resolution was defined as the resolution 
of cough (the sum of each symptom in the CET =5) (Table 1) for 2 
consecutive days. The first day of the consecutive 2-day period was 
considered the event date. 
Secondary outcomes included the proportion of patients with cough 
resolution on Days 3, 5, and 7 (which was defined by a total CET score of 
5) and the proportion of patients with the resolution of other COVID-19- 
related symptoms by Days 3, 5, and 7. Other COVID-19-related symptoms 
included fever, stuffy or runny nose, sore throat, shortness of 
breath (difficulty breathing), fatigue, muscle aches, headache, cold or 
chills, nausea (wanting to vomit), vomiting, diarrhoea (loose or watery 
stools), and loss of smell or taste. 
Safety assessment was performed for patients who received at least 
one dose of kumquat decoction. The assessment included patients’ self- 
reported AEs after receiving kumquat decoction. Patients in the 
kumquat group were required to record the incidence and time of any 
AEs that were potentially related to kumquat decoction during and after 
the first dose of kumquat decoction. Causality between AEs and the 
treatment and seriousness of AEs were assessed by clinical investigators 
using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 5.0. 
Statistical analysis 
The data are described as percentages for categorical variables and 
the means (standard difference [SDs]) or medians (interquartile ranges 
[IQRs]) for continuous variables. The chi-square test, t test, and Mann- 
Whitney U test were employed as appropriate. 
The sample size was based on the number of eligible patients at the 
five hospitals mentioned above from December 31, 2022, to January 3, 
2023, as opposed to a formal statistical hypothesis. Propensity score (PS) 
analyses were employed to reduce the risk of selection bias in the 
kumquat decoction treatment group. The primary analysis utilized PS 
matching (PSM), implementing a 1:1 nearest neighbour matching 
approach with a calliper width of 0.01. The probability of receiving 
kumquat decoction was estimated by multivariable logistic regression 
that adjusted for the following variables: age, sex, duration of cough 
from onset to enrolment, vaccination status, smoking status, cough 
medication prior to baseline, CET score at baseline, hypertension, diabetes, 
coronary heart disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, and cerebrovascular 
disease. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was 
employed to evaluate the difference between the two groups after PSM. 
Finally, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the 
hazard ratio (HR) for time to sustained cough resolution and its 95% 
confidence interval (CI) after PSM. The proportional hazards assumption 
was assessed by the log-minus-log-survival function. 
Time to sustained cough resolution was evaluated using the Kaplan- 
Meier method and restricted mean survival time (RMST). The differences 
in Kaplan–Meier curves were tested with log-rank tests. RMST is a 
statistical measure that represents the mean survival time for a defined 
period (Uno et al., 2014) and is considered an alternative to the median 
survival time. The difference and ratio between groups in RMST during 
the Day 0-7 follow-up period were reported. Patients who were lost to 
follow-up or still had cough symptoms on the last day of follow-up 
(January 31, 2023) were censored. We did not perform subgroup analyses 
due to the relatively small sample size of subgroups. 
To test the robustness of our study, we used different methods to 
control for confounders and evaluate the effectiveness of kumquat 
decoction on cough resolution. Specifically, we conducted four secondary 
analyses: (1) univariate and (2) multivariable Cox proportional 
hazards models using the original cohort, (3) a PS-adjusted Cox proportional 
hazards model that included all patients, and (4) a PS analysis 
with pairwise algorithmic (PA) models (Li and Greene, 2013) that also 
included all patients. Furthermore, we conducted two additional sensitivity 
analyses, one excluding patients who received other treatments for 
cough in the kumquat group and the other focusing on the follow-up 
period of Days 0-7, excluding data obtained from the final follow-up 
day. The proportion of missing data for covariates was less than 5%, 
and we did not use any techniques to handle this. In addition, we 
assessed the possibility of unmeasurable confounding by calculating 
E-values (Haneuse et al., 2019). Statistical significance was set at P <
0.05. The statistical analyses were performed using R (v.3.3.2, R Foundation 
for Statistical Computing) and the Free Statistics analysis platform 
(v.1.8). 
Results 
Study participants 
Our study enrolled 1434 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who 
visited the outpatient department of five township hospitals between 
December 31 and January 3, 2023. Of these patients, 928 received 
kumquat decoction while 506 did not. After excluding 627 patients 
without cough (CET score =5), 14 with chronic lung disease, and 30 
Q. Hua et al. 
heavy smokers, 763 patients met the eligibility criteria (Fig. 1) and were 
included in the primary analysis for cough assessment. The characteristics 
of patients before and after propensity-score matching are shown 
in Table 2. 
Of the 763 patients included in this study, 27 (3.54%) patients did 
not have complete baseline data (listed in Table 2) and were excluded 
from the PS analyses for cough assessment. Among the remaining 736 
patients, the median age was 38.0 (IQR: 29.0, 50.0) years, 55.7% were 
women, 459 (62.36%) received kumquat decoction with a median 
duration of 6 (IQR: 5, 7) days, and 277 (37.6%) did not receive it. 191 
(41.6%) kumquat decoction users received the first formula within 6 
days after cough symptom onset. 
In the unmatched sample, the use of kumquat decoction differed 
according to sex, smoking status, time from cough onset to enrollment, 
whether cough treatment was received prior to baseline and baseline 
CET score. Kumquat decoction-treated patients had a higher proportion 
of smokers, and a higher baseline CET score (SMD >0.1). The time from 
cough onset to enrollment was longer in the kumquat decoction group 
(kumquat group) (SMD >0.1). After PSM, all covariates were well 
balanced (i.e., SMD <0.1). 
Primary outcome 
Over a median follow-up of 7.000 (95% CI, 6.868 to 7.132) days, 
cough resolution was achieved for 313 (68.2%) patients in the kumquat 
group (93.77 per 1000 person-days) and 110 (39.7%) patients in the 
usual care group (72.94 per 1000 person-days). Given the substantial 
censoring of follow-up data on cough resolution in the usual care group 
beyond Day 7 and thus the minimum of the longest follow-up times for 
both groups being 7 days, we opted to compute the RMST within the 
time window of Days 0-7. 
The RMST during 7 days of follow-up for the kumquat group was 
4.307 (95% CI, 3.967 to 4.648) days and for the usual care group was 
5.050 (95% CI, 4.693 to 5.406) days. The kumquat group exhibited a 
statistically significant reduction of 0.742 days (95% CI, -1.235 to 
-0.250, P =0.003) in cough resolution time at the 7-day follow-up 
compared to the usual care group (Table 3). In the primary 
propensity-score matched analyses, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for 
cough resolution in the kumquat group compared with the usual care 
group was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.48 to 2.53, P <0.001). 
Sensitivity analyses 
We conducted several sensitivity analyses with different methods to 
test the robustness of the results. The kumquat decoction group was 
more likely to achieve cough resolution than the usual care group in the 
crude (HR, 1.30; 95% CI,1.04 to 1.62) and the multivariable analysis 
(HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.68). Additional propensity-score analyses 
with PA (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.68) or adjusted for propensity score 
yielded similar results (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.66) (Table 3). The 
Kaplan–Meier estimate of the resolution rate of cough is shown in Fig. 2. 
During the study phase, only 31 patients (6.4%) received other 
treatments for cough in the kumquat group. We performed a sensitivity 
analysis excluding these patients and find similar results (Appendix C, 
Table C.1). On January 31, 2023, the last follow-up was conducted. 
However, the number of effective follow-ups in the usual care group was 
considerably lower (n =5) than that in the kumquat group (n =131). To 
ensure the reliability of our results, we conducted another sensitivity 
analysis focusing on the follow-up period of Days 0-7 and did not use 
data obtained from the final follow-up day. The results obtained from 
this analysis were consistent with the primary findings (refer to Appendix 
C, Table C.2 for further details). Additionally, the Kaplan–Meier 
curve for cough resolution within 0-7 days is shown in Fig. 2B (before 
PSM) and Fig. 2D (after PSM). 
Furthermore, we calculated the E-value to evaluate the potential 
effect of unmeasured confounding factors. The E-value was 2.536 
derived from PSM analysis, suggesting that a strong concurrent 
confounder was required to negate the observed HR, which indicated 
the robustness of our primary findings. 
Secondary outcomes 
The proportion of patients with cough resolution by Days 3, 5, and 7 
after enrolment is shown in Table 4. There was no difference between 
the kumquat decoction and the usual care group in baseline CET scores 
in the two PS-matched groups. The proportion of patients with cough 
resolution was higher in the kumquat group than in the usual care group 
by Day 5 (64.9% in the kumquat group vs. 49.5% in the usual care 
group) and Day 7 (93% in the kumquat group vs. 39.6% in the usual care 
group) (Table 4). 
Table C.3 (Appendix C) displays the resolution of 13 additional 
COVID-19-related symptoms by Days 3, 5, and 7. Kumquat decoction 
use was associated with the resolution of stuffy nose on Days 5 and 7, as 
well as the resolution of sore throat on Day 7 following medication. 
Safety 
The safety population included all 928 patients who received 
kumquat decoction. AEs that may have been associated with kumquat 
decoction as assessed by clinical investigations included abdominal 
discomfort (2/928, 0.215%), abdominal distension (1/928, 0.107%), 
abdominal pain (1/928, 0.107%), diarrhoea (1/928, 0.107%), vomiting 
(1/928, 0.107%), nausea (3/928, 0.323%), discomfort with the falling 
anus (1/928, 0.107%), spicy throat (2/928, 0.215%), and itchy throat 
(2/928, 0.215%). No deaths or serious adverse events occurred. Details 
of the AEs are provided in Appendix D. 
Discussion 
In this real-world study involving mild-to-moderate COVID-19 patients, 
we observed that kumquat decoction use was significantly associated 
with earlier resolution of COVID-19-related cough (HR, 1.94; 
95% CI, 1.48 to 2.53), indicating that over a median follow-up of 7 days, 
the use of kumquat decoction was 1.94 times more likely to result in 
cough resolution than usual care. The difference in RMST was -0.742 
days (95% CI, -1.235 to -0.250, P =0.003) days, which was significantly 
in favour of the kumquat decoction group after 7 days of follow-up. This 
result was consistent with the observed HRs greater than 1 in different 
PS analyses and in patients without other concomitant antitussive 
medicines. Kumquat decoction use was significantly associated with 
higher rates of resolution of stuffy nose on Days 5 and 7 and of sore 
throat on Day 7 after enrolment. No serious adverse effects occurred in 
the kumquat group. Our findings demonstrated the potential of dietary 
herb medicine to alleviate cough symptoms, thereby providing new 
evidence and insights into the treatment of COVID-19-related cough. Fig. 1.Flowchart of the primary analysis for cough assessment 
Q. Hua et al. 
During the study phase spanning from December 2022 to January 
2023, the Omicron variant was the predominant strain. The median time 
to sustained cough resolution (6 days) was similar to that in other 
Omicron studies (DeWitt et al., 2023). By Day 3, no significant difference 
was observed in the proportion of patients with cough resolution 
between the two groups, but by Days 5 and 7, a significant difference 
emerged, suggesting that a 5-day course of kumquat decoction elicited 
an appropriate accumulating effect. Kumquat decoction contains 
various active ingredients, including Fortunella margarita Swingle 3, 
polyphenolic components, synephrine, and stachydrine, which have 
been demonstrated to have potent antioxidant (Sadek et al., 2009; Zeng 
et al., 2015), antitussive (Shi et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2020), and 
antiallergic properties (Fu et al., 2019; Oh et al., 2010). However, more 
research is necessary to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms. 
TCM provides a rich reservoir of safe-to-use medicine candidates or 
“medical food” (Schmidt et al., 2007). Among these, the six ingredients 
of kumquat decoction are all used as medical food in China, which were 
commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and everyday cooking. 
The accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of kumquat decoction 
make it more like herb tea and may serve as an alternative to antitussive 
medication, particularly for patients receiving home-based care. 
Therefore, kumquat decoction may help ease the burden on healthcare 
systems and provide symptom relief to patients who might otherwise not 
have access to care. Its effectiveness, affordability, and lower safety 
concerns make it a promising intervention for the management of 
COVID-19-related cough. 
Our study has some limitations. First, recall bias on the last follow-up 
might have influenced the accuracy of cough resolution dates. Since we 
followed up on these patients consecutively on Days 0-7 after enrolment 
and on 31 January 2023. The long follow-up interval for the last follow- 
up may have resulted in recall bias. Second, the percentage of censored 
data was slightly high, which may have introduced bias. This may be 
because of the participants’ difficulty in recollecting the specific date of 
cough resolution at the last follow-up visit. Third, in this study, although 
likely confounders were adjusted, including age, sex, duration of cough 
from onset to enrolment, vaccination status, smoking status, cough 
treatment prior to enrolment, CET score at baseline, and comorbidities, 
there maight still have been certain unmeasured confounders, as in all

Since the RMST inference is only available for the period up to the minimum of 
the latest follow-up for the two groups. We choose the time window of 0-7 days 
to compute the RMST using data after PSM.

observational studies. In the sensitivity analysis, we used the E-value to 
assess unmeasured confounding and found that the results were robust 
unless a strong unmeasured confounder existed simultaneously to 
change the observed effectiveness. 
Despite the above limitations, our study has notable strengths. First, 
the multicentre study design increases the generalizability of the results. 
Second, we used a variety of methods to minimize possible confounding. 
In the main PSM analysis, we found that kumquat decoction use was 
associated with a higher proportion of cough resolution, and the results 
remained robust to a series of sensitivity analyses using several 
propensity score approaches and excluding patients who received 
concomitant treatments in the kumquat group. Finally, further large- 
scale prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted to 
confirm our results. 
Conclusion 
Kumquat decoction was significantly associated with greater 
improvement in COVID-19-related cough among patients with mild-to- 
moderate COVID-19. This study provided real-world evidence for the 
Fig. 2.Kaplan–Meier curves for cough resolution before (A, B) and after (C, D) PSM, (A) During the whole follow-up period before PSM; (B) during Days 0-7 before 
PSM; (C) during the whole follow-up period after PSM; (D) during Days 0-7 after PSM. The Kaplan-Meier curves for the resolution rate of cough are shown. The 
percentage of patients who achieved cough resolution at individual time points was demonstrated for the kumquat decoction and usual care groups (red for kumquat 
decoction group, blue for usual care group). The hazard ratio for cough resolution during the whole follow-up period before PSM (Panel A) was 1.26 (95% CI, 
confidence intervals, 1.01–1.57; P =0.036), during Days 0-7 before PSM (Panel B) was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.85–1.38; P =0.42), during the whole follow-up period after 
PSM (Panel C) was 1.94 (95% CI, 0.48–2.53; P <0.001), and during Days 0-7 after PSM (Panel D) was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.31-2.30; P <0.001). The shaded areas 
represent pointwise 95% CI. The horizontal dashes line in each panel indicates the 50% resolution rate of cough. Tick marks indicate censored data. Abbreviations:
