OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence of postoperative, persistent 
hypoparathyroidism after total or completion thyroidectomy in patients who were 
referred to university hospital centers and assess the association of different 
definitions with the incidence of hypoparathyroidism.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective multicenter cohort study 
conducted throughout 2016 in 7 Dutch university hospital centers included 200 
patients who were undergoing a total or completion thyroidectomy. Data analysis 
was conducted in January 2021.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We report on the incidence of persistent 
hypoparathyroidism, defined as the need for active vitamin D with or without 
calcium supplementation longer than 1 year after surgery.
RESULTS: A total of 200 patients (143 women [71.5%]; mean [IQR] age, 49.0 
[37.0-62.0] years) were included and 30 patients (15.0%) developed persistent 
hypoparathyroidism. The incidence of persistent hypoparathyroidism varied 
between 14.5% (calcium and active vitamin D 1 year postsurgery) to 28.5% 
(calcium and/or active vitamin D 6 months postsurgery) depending on the 
definition used.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, the risk of persistent 
hypoparathyroidism after total or completion thyroidectomy was 15% in patients 
who were referred to university hospital centers. The high rate of persistent 
hypoparathyroidism warrants efforts to reduce this complication rate. There is 
discrepancy in the definition and treatment of persistent hypoparathyroidism, 
and use of uniform evidence-based treatment guidelines enables comparison of 
interventions.
