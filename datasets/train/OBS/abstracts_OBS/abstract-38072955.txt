1/INTRODUCTION: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is one of the leading causes of nephrotic syndrome in adults. This epidemiological study describes a renal centre's 20-year experience of primary FSGS. 
2/METHODS: Patients were identified with a diagnosis of primary FSGS after exclusion of known secondary causes. In this retrospective observational study, data was collected for baseline demographics, immunosuppression and outcomes. A two-step cluster analysis was used to identify natural groupings within the dataset. 
3/RESULTS: The total cohort was made up of 87 patients. Those who received immunosuppression had lower median serum albumin than those who did not- 23g/L vs 40g/L (p<0.001) and higher median urine protein creatinine ratios (uPCR)- 795mg/mmol vs 318mg/mmol (p <0.001). They were more likely to achieve complete remission (62% vs 40%, p=0.041), but relapsed more 48.6% vs 22% (p=0.027). Overall 5 year mortality was 10.3% and 5 year progression to RRT was seen in 17.2%. Complete remission was observed in 49.4%. The 2-step cluster analysis separated the cohort into 3 clusters: cluster 1 (n=26) with 'nephrotic-range proteinuria'; cluster 2 (n=43) with 'non-nephrotic-range proteinuria'; and cluster 3 (n=18) with nephrotic syndrome. Immunosuppression use was comparable in clusters 1 and 3, but lower in cluster 2 (77.8% and 69.2% vs 11.6%, p<0.001). Rates of complete remission were greatest in clusters 1 and 3 vs cluster 2: 57.7% and 66.7% vs 37.2%. 
4/CONCLUSION: People who received immunosuppression had lower serum albumin and achieved remission more frequently, but were also prone to relapse. Our cluster analysis highlighted 3 FSGS phenotypes: a nephrotic cluster that clearly require immunosuppression; a cohort with preserved serum albumin and non-nephrotic range proteinuria who will benefit from supportive care; and lastly a cluster with heavy proteinuria but serum albumin > 30g/L. This group may still have immune mediated disease and thus could potentially benefit from immunosuppression. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study protocol was reviewed and approved by the 'Research and Innovation committee of the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group', study approval number (Ref: ID 22HIP54).
