1/BACKGROUND: A hybrid emergency room (ER) is defined as an emergency unit with   four functions-performing resuscitation, computed tomography (CT), surgery, and   angiography. However, the safety and efficacy of performing CT in a hybrid ER   are unclear in primary surveys. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the   safety and clinical effects of hybrid ERs.  
2/METHODS: This retrospective observational study used data from the Shimane   University Hospital Trauma Database from January 2016 to February 2019.   Hospitalized patients with severe trauma and an injury severity score of â‰¥ 16   were divided into the non-hybrid ER group (n = 134) and the hybrid ER group (n =   145). The time from arrival to CT and interventions and the number of   in-hospital survivors, preventable trauma deaths (PTD), and unexpected survivors   (US) were assessed in both groups. Further, the amount of blood transfused was   compared between the groups using propensity score matching.  
3/RESULTS: The time from arrival to CT and interventions was significantly reduced   in the hybrid ER group compared to that in the non-hybrid ER group (25 vs. 6   min; p < 0.0001 and 101 vs. 41 min; p = 0.0007, respectively). There was no   significant difference in the rate of in-hospital survivors (96.9% vs. 96.3%; p   = 0.770), PTD (0% vs. 0%), and US (9.0 vs. 6.2%; p = 0.497) between the groups.   The amount of blood transfused was significantly lower in the hybrid ER group   than in the non-hybrid ER group (whole blood 14 vs. 8, p = 0.004; red blood cell   6 vs. 2, p = 0.012; fresh frozen plasma 9 vs. 6, p = 0.021). This difference was   maintained after propensity score matching (whole blood 28 [10-54] vs. 6   [4-16.5], p = 0.015; RBC 8 [2.75-26.5] vs. 2 [0-8.5], p = 0.020, 18 [5.5-27] vs.   6 [3.5-7.5], p = 0.057).  
4/CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that trauma treatment in a hybrid ER is   as safe as conventional treatment performed in a non-hybrid ER. Further, hybrid   ERs, which can reduce the time for trauma surveys and treatment, do not require   patient transfer and can reduce the amount of blood transfused during   resuscitation.
