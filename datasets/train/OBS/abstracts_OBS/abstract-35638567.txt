BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can impact sensory, pain and tolerance 
thresholds in various ways, which can be accessed via quantitative sensory 
testing (QST). The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the subjective 
sensory responses using QST in patients following SCS therapy for PSPS and (2) 
to get a clinical impression of the results of SCS during an interview of these 
patients with PSPS and SCS during long term follow-up.
METHODS: Forty patients with PSPS who received SCS treatment underwent QST via 
electrical and mechanical pressure stimuli. QST was performed at four different 
moments (1) pre-implantation SCS, (2) two weeks postoperatively, (3) three 
months after permanent SCS implantation and (4) six months after permanent SCS 
implantation. Patients' perspectives on pain, use of drugs and quality of life 
were assessed via semi-structured interviews during a follow-up between 5 and 
11â€‰years.
RESULTS: We found statistical significant differences in the changes of sensory, 
pain and tolerance thresholds. A decrease in pain complaints and analgesics use 
were reported by the patients during follow-up. The quality of life in patients 
increased from three to eight (NRS 0 [worst QoL imaginable] -10 [best QoL 
imaginable]) after receiving SCS.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased thresholds on areas without pain or being covered by 
the SCS induced paresthesias may indicate that there are central changes 
contributing to these deviations in thresholds. The overall QoL in patients 
improved greatly after receiving SCS.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides an overview of the effect of SCS on sensory, 
pain and tolerance thresholds in patients with PSPS throughout the SCS treatment 
process. In addition, this study presents data from 40 patients with PSPS 
treated with SCS, analysing several long-term patient-reported outcome measures. 
The results serve to give more insight into the mechanism of SCS and document 
SCS as a possible treatment for PSPS.
