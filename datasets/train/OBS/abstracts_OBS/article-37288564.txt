Introduction

Patients with untreated significant left main coronary artery (LMCA) 
disease have a poor prognosis and revascularization with coronary artery 
bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention 
(PCI) is indicated.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
The 2018 ESC/EACTS Guidelines on myocardial 
revascularization, which relies on evidence from randomized clinical 
trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses, suggest equivalent results for the composite 
of death, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke up to 5 years of 
follow-up when comparing CABG with PCI.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
There is a significant and 
beneficial interaction between time and PCI with regard to MI and peri- 
interventional stroke, however this is offset by risk of spontaneous MI 
and new revascularization during follow-up.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/


The recommendations for choosing mode of revascularization of unprotected 
LMCA disease is based on coronary anatomical complexity 
assessed by the Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac 
Surgery (SYNTAX) score,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
individual cardiac and extracardiac characteristics, 
and patient preference. For patients with a low SYNTAX 


score (=22), PCI and CABG have the same class and level of recommendation 
(I A), but for patients with intermediate SYNTAX score 
(23–32) the recommendation for CABG is I A and for PCI 
IIa A. Only CABG is recommended (I A) for patients with very complex 
coronary anatomy (SYNTAX score =33) and PCI is not recommended 
(III B) for such patients.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/


The recommendations are, to a large extent, based on RCTs that 
have been conducted in highly selected cohorts. Consequently, the 
guidelines and the RCTs may not be fully applicable to the diversity 
of real-life patients and circumstances associated with revascularization 
of LMCA disease in clinical practice. Thus, we analysed the outcome of 
all subjects with LMCA disease undergoing revascularization with PCI 
or CABG in Sweden between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015.

Methods

Study population

All patients undergoing coronary angiography, PCI and CABG in Sweden 
are registered in the Swedish Web-system for Enhancement and 
Development of Evidence-based care in Heart disease Evaluated 
According to Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry which includes 
the Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry and the 
Swedish Cardiac Surgery Registry. All subjects that underwent coronary 
angiography in 28 PCI centres in Sweden during the 11 years from 1 
January 2005, to 31 December 2015 were screened. We included 11 137 
patients who had undergone revascularization with either PCI or CABG 
due to LMCA disease within 3 months after the index angiography. 
Exclusion criteria were previous CABG (excluding protected LMCA disease), 
ST-elevation MI and/or cardiogenic shock, subjects deemed and registered 
not being eligible for CABG, patients with data error or age <18 
years, no revascularization within 90 days after coronary angiography, 
and PCI in left main with another device than first-, second-, or third- 
generation drug-eluting stent (DES) (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
). The study was reviewed 
and approved by the local ethics committee in Stockholm, Sweden 
(2015/1258–31).

Outcomes

All subjects were followed through the Swedish Population Register for 
death, the Swedish National Patient Registry (NPR) for MI and stroke, 
and the SWEDEHEART registry for MI and repeat revascularization after 
the index angiography until the onset of outcome or until 31 December 
2015. New revascularization was defined as new PCI or new CABG during 
follow-up. Major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events 
(MACCE) were defined as death, MI, stroke, or new revascularization 
(whichever occurred first) within the follow-up period.

Co-variates

Variables associated with mortality available in the SWEDEHEART and the 
NPR registers, as well as administrative region and year of treatment were 
used for adjustments. Multivariable analysis included the year of treatment, 
administrative region, body mass index, diabetes mellitus (diabetes mellitus 
diagnosis known to the patient, independently of treatment), insulin treatment 
(yes/no), estimated creatinine clearance, indication for revascularization 
[non-ST-elevation MI (NSTEMI)/unstable angina, stable angina], 
number of diseased coronary arteries (left main, left main + one-vessel, 
left main + two-vessel, left main + three vessel disease), smoking status 
(no, former smoker, current smoker), age at diagnosis, gender, previous 
MI, previous PCI, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), peripheral 
artery disease, history of cancer, and dialysis. Hypertension was defined 
as treatment with anti-hypertensive drug and hyperlipidaemia as treatment 
with statins. COPD was defined as medication with bronchodilators or 
steroids for lung disease. Administrative region was categorized 
(Stockholm, Uppsala-Örebro, South-east, South, West, North). The risk 
of surgery was assessed using the European System for Cardiac 
Operative Risk Evaluation Score (EuroSCORE) IIhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
in CABG patients only.

Statistics

Baseline characteristics of patients in the PCI and CABG groups were described 
as frequencies for categorical variables and the mean value with 
standard deviations for continuous variables. The chi-square test and 
t-test were applied separately to compare the distribution of characteristics 
in the two groups at baseline. Due to an imbalance between the groups, we 
applied the inverse probability weighting (IPW) method to create a 
weighted population after which the distribution of characteristics was similar 
in the two groups.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Propensity scores and standard mean differences 
prior and following IPW adjustments are presented in http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
.

A standard Cox regression model reporting hazard ratios (HRs) together 
with Laplace regression to compare the median survival timehttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
was used as 
the primary analysis to compare the PCI and CABG groups. The models 
were built on weighted population to calculate HR with 95% confidence 
interval (CI) and median of event free time between PCI and CABG patients 
as two comparable groups.

We performed instrumental variable (IV) analyseshttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
to adjust for unknown 
confounders. For an IV analysis, one must identify a naturally varying 
variable in the observed data which predicts the treatment that will be assigned 
to the individual patient. The IV variable must fulfil the following criteria: 
(i) it must be associated with the received treatment and (ii) it must 
not be associated directly or indirectly with the outcome, except through 
the effect of the treatment itself. We identified the variable administrative 
region (Stockholm, Uppsala-Örebro, South-east, South, West, North) 
to be associated with the received treatment, PCI or CABG 
(see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). The variable administrative region 
is not expected to be associated with the outcome, except through 
the effect of the treatment itself. To test for the strength of the instrument 
variable, we examined the partial F-test, which predicts treatment as a function 
of the instrument and covariates. The partial F-test has the null hypothesis 
that the coefficient for the effect of the instrument in the first-stage 
regression model is zero.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
An F-statistic >10 indicates that the instrument 
is not weak. The F-value for the association of the IV, administrative region, 
with treatment (PCI or CABG) was 153 and the IV was considered valid. 
The IV might be imperfect, thus the following variables were entered in 
the IV regression to also adjust for known confounders; age, gender, number 
of diseased coronary arteries, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, year of 
treatment, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, insulin treatment, estimated 
creatinine clearance, indication for revascularization, smoking status, previous 
MI, previous PCI, COPD, peripheral artery disease, history of cancer, 
and dialysis. All the analyses were performed using Stata MP 17.1. The significance 
level of the statistic tests was set to 0.05.

Results

A total of 11 137 patients were included of which 9364 (84%) patients 
had undergone CABG and 1773 (16%) PCI. The proportion of patients 
treated with PCI increased from 7% in 2005 to 34% in 2015 (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). There was a large regional variation 
in the choice of revascularization method ranging from 8% PCI 
in the South and West regions to 34% in the Uppsala-Örebro regions 
(see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). Subjects undergoing PCI 
were three years older than CABG patients. Hyperlipidaemia, previous 
MI, previous PCI, reduced renal function and isolated left main stenosis 
were more common in the PCI than in the CABG group (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). A 
history of smoking, diabetes mellitus, peripheral artery disease and 
LMCA disease combined with three vessel disease were more common 
in the CABG group. Most of the patients were revascularized due to 
NSTEMI and/or unstable angina, but chronic coronary syndrome 
(CCS) was significantly more common in the CABG group (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
).

The CABG patients had a median EuroSCORE II risk of 4% (interquartile 
range 3%–7%), and 73% of the patients had normal left ventricular 
function. The left internal thoracic artery (ITA) was used in 
more than 90% of the cases, whereas both ITA in 2% of the cases. 
Three or more distal anastomoses were performed in 77% of the patients 
(http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
).

Two-hundred and eighty-five patients (16%) had first generation, 
1324 (75%) had second generation and 164 (9%) patients had third- 
generation DES in the LMCA (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). One thousand five-hundred fifty-seven patients (88%) had 
one stent in the left main, 207 patients (11.5%) had two stents, and 
nine patients (0.5%) had three stents positioned in the left main.

Outcome

The median follow-up for the whole cohort was 4.7 years (interquartile 
range 2.1–7.6). The crude incidence rates for death, MI, revascularization, 
and MACCE were higher in the PCI group compared to the 
CABG group (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). IPW-adjusted HR (aHR) comparing PCI with 
CABG were significant for mortality (aHR 2.0, 95% CI 1.5–2.7), MI 
(aHR 4.0, 95% CI 2.9–5.5), new revascularization (aHR 5.1, 95% CI 
3.8–7.0), and MACCE (aHR 2.5, 95% CI 1.9–3.2). After adjustment 
for unknown confounders in the IV analysis, the differences between 
groups were still evident for mortality (IV-HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.0), 
MI (IV-HR 6.1, 95% CI 1.4–26.3), new revascularization (IV-HR 14.0, 
95% CI 5.8–33.6), and MACCE (IV-HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.8–4.5). There 
were no significant differences in HRs for stroke before (crude HR 
1.2, 95% CI 0.95–1.2) or after adjustments (aHR 1.2, 95% CI 0.77– 
1.9 and IV-HR 5.1, 95% CI 0.72–35.8) (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
).

Crude and IPW-adjusted one-minus survival curves for mortality, MI 
and stroke are presented in http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
. 
Thirty-day event rates are presented in http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
.

Of the 580 new revascularizations in the CABG group, 26 (4.5%) 
were done by CABG and 128 (22.0%) included revascularizations of 
one or more grafts. There were 235 new revascularizations in the 
PCI group of which 41(17%) included left main revascularization and 
18 (7.7%) were done by CABG.

The incidence of hospitalizations for serious non-cardiac events 
(Alzheimer/Parkinson, bleeding, infection, chronic pulmonary obstructive 
disease, malignant tumor, peripheral artery disease, renal insufficiency, 
any trauma) was higher in the PCI group than in the CABG 
group (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
).

Outcome in subgroups

IPW- aHRs for mortality (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
) and MACCE (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
) for PCI vs. 
CABG are presented for (i) left main and left main plus one vessel 
and left main plus two or three vessels, (ii) diabetes and no diabetes, 
(iii) age >70 years and age =70 years, (iv) women and men, and (v) 
for patients undergoing angiography at hospital with and without thoracic 
surgery. There was a significant quantitative interaction for diabetes 
status with a larger benefit for CABG vs. PCI in patients with diabetes 
with regard to mortality compared to non-diabetic patients (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). 
There was also an interaction for MACCE with regard to number of 
diseased vessels showing a larger benefit for CABG vs. PCI in patients 
with left main plus two or three vessels disease compared to left main 
only or left main plus one vessel disease (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). Patients =70 years

To illustrate the difference in expected survival between CABG

in the whole cohort and subgroups are presented in http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
. 
There was a benefit in median survival time for CABG vs. PCI in 
the whole cohort as well as in the subgroups. Furthermore, there 
was a notable difference in IPW-adjusted median survival time of 
3.6 years (95% CI 3.3–4.0) in favour of CABG compared to PCI in patients 
with diabetes.

Discussion

The main finding in this observational non-randomized study of all- 
comers with LMCA disease was that CABG was associated with lower 
mortality and fewer cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events compared 
to PCI before and after multivariable adjustment for known 
and unknown confounders (http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
).

There are several factors that make the comparison between 
CABG and PCI challenging: (i) the unequal number of patients in 
the groups; (ii) substantial differences in baseline characteristics; (iii) 
unknown selection mechanisms for choice of the revascularization 
method; and (iv) the PCI group, consisting of more frail patients, 
had more hospitalisations due to non-cardiac events. Despite these 
challenges, it is important to analyse revascularization mode in relation 
to outcomes in observational registry studies to complement 
RCTs. In RCTs, the external validity is restrained by the selection of 
patients, omitting older, more frail patients with a large number of comorbidities 
that are treated in the cardiology department in everyday 
clinical practice.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data


Adjustments for baseline characteristics

The treatment decision, CABG or PCI, for patients with left main coronary 
stenosis is based on a patient’s pre-treatment characteristics and 
personal preference.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
If these are imbalanced and associated with 
the study outcome, the assessment of the treatment effect from an

observational study suffers from bias caused by confounding by indication. 
We have thus adjusted for known confounders with the IPW 
method.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data


Adjustments for unknown confounders

In our study, important confounders such as SYNTAX score, 
EuroSCORE (in the PCI group), left ventricular ejection fraction (in 
the PCI group), site of LMCA lesion (shaft vs. bifurcation), proportion 
of calcified lesions or chronic total occlusions and heart team assessment 
(yes vs. no) are missing. The selection of revascularization 
mode is to a large extent associated with administrative region (see http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
). We used statistical modelling 
based on the IV to reduce bias due to unmeasured confounders. To 
use IV analysis, one must identify a naturally varying phenomenon in 
the observed data, which, like randomization in an RCT, predicts the

treatment assigned to the individual patient. A valid instrument must 
fulfil some necessary criteria. First, the variable has to be strongly associated 
(F-test >10) with the treatment received. Second, it must not be 
directly or indirectly associated with the outcome except through the 
effect of the treatment itself. The variable with these statistical qualities 
is called an IV. We used the administrative region as the treatment- 
preference instrument. The administrative region is frequently 
employed as an instrument because this variable type usually fulfils 
the theoretical criteria for a valid instrument.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
Because administrative 
region may be an imperfect instrument, the following variables 
were entered into IV regression: age, gender, number of diseased coronary 
arteries, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, year of treatment, body 
mass index, diabetes mellitus, insulin treatment, estimated creatinine 
clearance, indication for revascularization, smoking status, previous 
MI, previous PCI, COPD, peripheral artery disease, history of cancer, 
and dialysis.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data

Comparison to other studies on 
revascularisation strategies for 
LMCA disease

The two large landmark trials, the Nordic-Baltic-British Left Main 
Revascularization Study (NOBLE) and Evaluation of XIENCE 
Everolimus Eluting Stent Versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery 
for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization (EXCEL) trial, evaluating 
PCI vs. CABG for LMCA disease have reported conflicting results.
http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
The NOBLE trial reported that CABG was superior to 
PCI in 1201 subjects up to 5 years of follow-up. The primary endpoint, 
a combination of all-cause mortality, non-procedural MI, any repeat 
coronary revascularization, and stroke, was more frequent in subjects 
assigned to PCI.

In the EXCEL trial, PCI and CABG showed comparable results with 
regard to the primary endpoint, a composite of death, stroke, or MI at 3 
and 5 years of follow-up. Of note, total mortality was significantly higher 
in the PCI group than in the CABG group and CABG proved to be 
beneficial over PCI when adding revascularization to outcome at 5 
years.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
The European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery has 
withdrawn its support from the current recommendation on treatment 
of left main disease in the 2018 ESC/EACTS myocardial revascularization 
guidelines. They state that there is a significant survival 
advantage of CABG over PCI in the EXCEL trial and that the EXCEL 
investigators adopted a new definition for MI leading to results appearing 
to favour the PCI option.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data


Patients in our observational study differ from the patients included 
in RCTs. The patients in our cohort were approximately 4 years older 
compared to subjects in the NOBLE and EXCEL trials. CCS was the 
predominant indication for index revascularization in the NOBLE and 
EXCEL trials (82% and 53%, respectively) whereas the rate of CCS 
was 30.9% in our cohort. In the NOBLE trial, complex lesions (chronic 
total occlusions, non-left main bifurcation lesions requiring two stent 
techniques or lesions with calcified or tortuous vessel morphology) 
were excluded and there was a high proportion of isolated left main disease.
http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
In the EXCEL trial, patients with high anatomical complexity of 
coronary artery disease as defined by a SYNTAX score of =33, were 
excluded. In our analysis, we have not excluded subjects based on 
the complexity of the coronary artery disease. In fact, almost half of 
the PCI patients had four or more stents. Furthermore, we have included 
patients that were stented with first-, second- and third- 
generation DES.

In a meta-analysis of individual patient data from four clinical randomised 
trials comparing 5-year outcomes for PCI with DES (n = 2197) 
with CABG (n = 2197) for LMCA disease, there was no significant difference 
in 5-year mortality between groups.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
However, 


Figure 5 Inverse probability weighting adjusted median survival for mortality for PCI vs. CABG in the whole cohort and subgroups. Thin bar at point 
estimate = 95% confidence interval.
complementary Bayesian analysis suggested a probable mortality difference 
(more likely than not <0.2% per year) in favour of CABG.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
This 
low, yet probable, excess risk for death within five years with PCI compared 
to CABG in patients eligible for RCTs could result in larger differences 
between groups in our study of consecutive all-comers 
including older, frailer patients with more comorbidities than patients 
in RCTs.

In a recent study from Canada, revascularization strategy in LMCA 
disease has been compared using clinical and administrative databases 
in Ontario.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
Like our study, Tam et al. reported that CABG was the 
preferred method for revascularization and propensity score matched 
analysis showed that PCI was associated with higher mortality (HR 1.63 
[95% CI 1.42–1.87]) and higher MACCE rates (HR 1.77 [95% CI 1.57– 
2.00]). Additionally, differences in patient characteristics between the 
PCI and CABG groups were similar to our study. Patients who underwent 
PCI were older, more often women, more likely presented with 
an acute coronary syndrome event, but had fewer diseased coronary 
vessels.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data


Possible mechanisms for differences 
in mortality

Invasive treatment with PCI or CABG restores flow in obstructive lesions 
in fundamentally different ways. With PCI, a DES is positioned 
in flow-limiting lesions after balloon dilatation, leaving non-flow-limiting 
lesions untreated. With CABG, a blood conduit (arterial or venous 
graft) is sewn distal to the flow-limiting lesion, creating a collateral 
flow. Through distal surgical collateralization, the graft prevents 
non-flow-limiting lesions from causing MIs. Establishing distal collateral 
blood flow is an important feature of CABG since new MIs frequently 
develop in non-flow-limiting coronary segments.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
Most deaths in 
high-risk patients with proximal and extensive coronary artery disease 
are caused by MIs.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
RCTs in patients with left main and three-vessel 
disease have shown that CABG decreased the occurrence of new 
MIs more than PCI.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data

,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
Our study showed that CABG was associated 
with fewer MIs and supports evidence from RCTs, thus adding 
weight to the hypothesis that surgical collateralization and a larger proportion 
of complete revascularizationhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
are possible mechanisms responsible 
for the mortality benefit for CABG vs. PCI.

Subgroup analyses

There was a significant quantitative interaction for diabetes with a large 
difference in aHR for mortality favouring CABG over PCI. The interaction 
translates into a median survival benefit of 3.6 years for CABG 
compared to PCI. In the EXCELhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
and NOBLEhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
trials, there were 
no interactions for diabetes for the primary outcomes. However, we 
know from the randomized Future Revascularization Evaluation in 
Patients with Diabetes Mellitus: Optimal Management of Multivessel 
Disease trialhttp://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
that patients with diabetes and multivessel disease (excluding 
left main coronary stenosis) have a better outcome with 
CABG in comparison with PCI, including death from any cause. Our 
data reinforce diabetes as an important clinical factor when deciding 
on revascularization mode in LMCA disease. Effect modification for 
MACCE between concomitant coronary artery disease and type of revascularization 
has shown higher benefit for CABG in patients with 
more severe disease. This finding is line with the results from RCTs 
showing less repeat revascularization for CABG.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
,http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
This interaction 
could be mediated by more complete revascularization achieved with 
CABG.http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
There was also a quantitative interaction for age group with 
a larger benefit in MACCE for CABG compared to PCI in patients 
=70 years. The relatively larger procedural risks with CABG compared 
to PCI might lessen the beneficial effects compared to PCI in older 
patients.

IPW-adjusted median survival time

Since HRs are measurements of relative effects and not absolute treatment 
effects, they may be difficult to communicate to patients and physicians 
when discussing revascularization options for LMCA disease. In a 
study of patients’ preferences, only 38% of the subjects with LMCA disease 
or three-vessel disease consented to go through CABG, although 
CABG was the recommended option over PCI (n = 763).http://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehad369#supplementary-data
Thus, we 
analysed the IPW-adjusted median survival time for PCI and CABG 
for the whole cohort and subgroups. The median survival time might 
be helpful when discussing revascularization modes with the patients. 
The benefits of CABG with a longer median survival time must be scrutinized 
against the disadvantages with open-heart surgery. Longer hospital 
stays and recovery time, and higher risk of perioperative 
complications can all be discussed between the patient and the heart 
team. The differences in median survival time favour CABG in all subgroups 
and there is a large difference in survival for CABG vs. PCI in diabetic 
patients.

Limitations

The data in the SWEDEHEART registry are prospectively collected and 
the analysis is a post hoc non-randomized comparison of patients undergoing 
PCI or CABG for LMCA disease. The data are observational, and 
we have tried to adjust for known imbalances in patient characteristics 
with IPW adjustment. We do not have data in all patients about the 
SYNTAX score, EuroSCORE, LVEF, site of LMCA lesion, heart team 
assessment, or completeness of revascularization. However, IV adjustment 
allows estimation of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured 
confounding. A disadvantage with the IV analyses is a somewhat 
higher statistical uncertainty than with IPW adjustments, which manifests 
itself in larger CIs with less precise estimates and enhanced probability 
of type 2 error. Although IV adjustment models are designed to 
adjust for unknown confounders, residual confounding cannot be ruled 
out. The cohort of studied patients were entered into the registry between 
January 1st 2005 and December 31st 2015 and the selection of 
revascularization mode for patients with LMCA disease might differ in 
our study from today’s clinical practice.

Conclusion

In this non-randomized study, CABG in patients with LMCA disease 
was associated with lower mortality and fewer MACCE compared to 
PCI after multivariable adjustment for known and unknown 
confounders.
