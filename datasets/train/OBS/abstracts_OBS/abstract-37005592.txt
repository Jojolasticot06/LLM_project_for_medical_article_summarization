1/BACKGROUND: Hyaluronic acid (HA) injection has become a burgeoning method to treat premature ejaculation (PE) due to its high biocompatibility and structural properties. PURPOSE: In this study, we proposed a modified technique: injecting hyaluronic acid around coronal sulcus to treat PE, aiming to decrease the complications of hyaluronic acid injection in penis while achieving similar effects. 
2/METHOD: A total of 85 patients who had HA injection from January 2018 to December 2019 were analyzed retrospectively in our study. 31 patients received injection at glans penis and 54 patients received injection around coronal sulcus. Intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was mainly measured to estimate the efficacy and the severity of complications was assessed between two groups. 
3/RESULTS: The mean IELT was 123.0 ± 37.28 s of all patients, 124.7 ± 39.01 s of patients injecting at glans penis and 121.9 ± 36.58 s of patients injecting around coronal sulcus. IELT of all patients increased to 482.1 ± 121.7 s at 1 month, 331.2 ± 81.2 s at 3 month and 280 ± 80.4 s at 6 month. In the group of injecting at glans penis, the incidence of complications is 25.8% and it is 1.9% in the group of injecting around coronal sulcus. No severe complication was reported in both groups. 
4/CONCLUSION: The modified technique of injecting around coronal sulcus decreases complications and it has the potential to become a new injectable technique for treating premature ejaculation.
