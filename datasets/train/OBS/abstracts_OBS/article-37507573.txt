Introduction 

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), 
had a strong impact on healthcare systems worldwide [1]. 
Patients with severe pneumonia present high mortality 
due to the large number of complications they face [2]. 
Particularly, bacterial respiratory coinfection is a complication 
extensively studied in the field of virus pandemics 
such as severe influenza H1N1 pneumonia and 
is reported to be associated with the severity of illness, 
worse outcomes, and even with an increased risk of mortality 
[3]. 

In COVID-19 the prevalence of community-acquired 
bacterial respiratory coinfections (from now, bacterial 
coinfection) is reported to be inferior to 5% upon hospital 
admission [4–6]. Although the impact on mortality 
of this complication is still widely debated, almost threequarters 
of patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotics, 
so prescribing is significantly higher than the estimated 
prevalence of bacterial coinfection [7]. Rule out bacterial 
coinfection upon admission to the hospital in these 
patients could potentially limit antibiotics overuse and 
so reduce hospitalization costs, potential side-effects and 
the development of multi-drug resistant infections [8]. 

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a serum biomarker that has 
shown promise in discriminating between viral and bacterial 
infections [9, 10], being routinely used in combination 
with clinical evidences as a guide to antibiotic 
de-escalation/discontinuation in critically ill patients [11, 
12]. The role of PCT in community-acquired pneumonia 
(CAP) has been evaluated in multiple studies, with 

Take-home message 
In critically ill patients with pneumonia associated to coronavirus 
disease 2019 a single determination of either procalcitonin or 
C-reactive protein, at a single time point, is not enough to rule out 
a bacterial coinfection. 

no scientific consensus on its usefulness for diagnosis 
or antibiotic initiation [13, 14]. On the other hand, PCT 
showed promising results in the early recognition of bacterial 
coinfection in influenza pneumonia [15]. 

C-reactive protein (CRP), another well-known systemic 
marker of inflammation and tissue damage, is extensively 
used by clinicians to monitor infections [16]. In patients 
with COVID-19, admission CRP correlated with disease 
severity and tended to be a good predictor of adverse 
outcome [17]. Furthermore, in patients with CAP PCT 
is reported to be superior when assessing disease severity 
in the first 48 h since symptoms onset whereas CRP is 
a better choice in patients with symptoms for 3 or more 
days [18]. 

We therefore aimed to determine the role of PCT and 
CRP in the identification of bacterial coinfection among 
patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 

Methods 

Study design and patients 

We retrospectively analysed patients from the CIBERESUCICOVID 
study (NCT04457505), which had prospectively 
included consecutive patients aged = 
18 years 
with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 

across 55 Spanish intensive care units (ICUs) between 5 
February 2020 and 21 December 2021 (Supplementary 
Table 1). All consecutive patients admitted to the intensive 
care unit (ICU) were enrolled if reason for admission 
was COVID-19. Exclusion criteria for patients included: 

(1) unconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; (2) lack of data 
at baseline or hospital discharge; (3) lack of data on testing 
for bacterial infections and on the presence of bacterial 
pneumonia during hospital stay; (4) lack of data on 
both PCT and CRP at hospital and ICU admission; (5) 
patient transfer from another ICU or nursing-home; (6) 
antibiotic administration previous of hospital admission 
was also an exclusion criterion for patients not presenting 
a bacterial coinfection, in order to rule out possible 
false negative. 
The study received approval by the Institution’s Internal 
Review Board (Comité Ètic d’Investigació Clínica, 
registry number HCB/2020/0370). Local researchers 
maintained contact with a study team member, and 
participating hospitals obtained local ethics committee 
approval. We reported results in accordance with the 
Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines [19]. 

Data collection and definitions 

We collected data on demographics, comorbidities, clinical 
symptoms, and treatment. Standard laboratory and 
clinical data were collected at hospital and ICU admission, 
particularly PCT and CRP levels. The pharmacological 
treatments administered and interventions 
performed during hospital admission until either dis-
charge from hospital or death were also collected, as well 
as outcomes [20]. 

Bacterial coinfection was defined as any respiratory 
bacterial infection diagnosed by the treating physicians 
within 48 h since hospital admission, taking into account 
clinical, laboratory and imaging evidences, with the isolation 
of at least one respiratory pathogen in the blood or 
in a good quality respiratory sample (sputum, tracheal 
aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage) and/or positive urinary 
antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae or Legionella 
pneumophila. Infections occurring later than 48 h since 
hospital admission were considered as nosocomial 
infections and not included in the present analysis [21]. 
Patients were then classified according to whether or not 
the diagnosis of bacterial coinfection was met. 

Primary and secondary outcomes 

The primary outcome was to investigate whether PCT or 
CRP serum levels upon admission could predict bacterial 
coinfection among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. 
The secondary outcome was to evaluate the association 
of PCT and CRP with 30 days and 90 days mortality. 

Biomarkers in higher risk profile subpopulations 
and according to symptoms onset 

In order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of PCT and 
CRP in patients with an higher risk profile for bacterial 
coinfection, we conducted subgroups analyses considering 
the presence of septic shock and non-respiratory 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 
hospital admission. 

Furthermore, as PCT and CRP present different kinetics, 
we explored the potential correlation between biomarkers 
values and time since symptoms onset, by 
dividing the population in = 
48 h and>48 h from symptoms 
onset to hospital admission. 

Statistical analysis 

We reported the number and percentage of patients as 
categorical variables, and the median [first quartile (Q1); 
third quartile (Q3)] as continuous variables. Categorical 
variables were compared using the chi-squared test 
or Fisher’s exact test, whereas continuous variables were 
compared using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U 
test. 

To determine the predictive capacity of PCT and CRP 
at hospital admission for bacterial coinfection, we determined 
sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive 
value (NPV), and positive and negative likelihood 
ratio (LR) [22–24], along with the 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs). We performed these analyses using different 
PCT and CRP cut-off values based on different clinical 
significance thresholds. 

We analysed the association between PCT and CRP 
at hospital admission (at 48 h) and bacterial coinfection 
by means of a mixed-effects multivariable model [25, 
26], defined by a binomial probability distribution and a 
logit link function, with centres as a random effect. The 
multivariable model included the following variables 
based on clinical relevance only: age, sex, body mass 
index, comorbidities, SOFA (without respiratory system 
component), PaO2/FiO2 ratio at hospital admission, 
leukocytosis (= 
11 × 
109/L) at hospital admission, PCT 
at hospital admission, CRP at hospital admission and 
COVID-19 wave. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% CIs 
were calculated. Discrimination was assessed by the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). 

To describe 30 days mortality, we utilized a Cox regression 
model stratified on the centre variable [27]. A list of 
candidate predictors was established a priori based on 
previous findings and clinical constraints: age, sex, body 
mass index, comorbidities, SOFA (without respiratory 
system component), PaO2/FiO2 ratio at hospital admission 
PCT at hospital admission, CRP at hospital admission, 
leukocytosis (= 
11 × 
109/L) at hospital admission, 
respiratory support at hospital admission, septic shock at 

hospital admission, bacterial coinfection and COVID-19 
wave. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% CIs were calculated. 
Proportional hazards assumptions were tested 
with log minus log plots. Patients who were transferred 
to another hospital were censored in survival analyses. 
The same survival analysis was performed for 30 days 
mortality. 

Single collinearity in multivariable analyses was evaluated 
using the Pearson correlation (r) and multicollinearity 
was examined by means of the variance inflation 
factor (VIF). 

To account for missing data we used the multiple 
imputation method [28]; further details regarding the 
employed imputation methodology are presented in Supplementary 
Table 2. 

In addition, subgroup analysis were carried out taking 
into account the presence of septic shock, non-respiratory 
SOFA score (i.e., < 2 and = 
2) and time from first 
symptoms to hospital admission [i.e., early admission 
(= 
48 h) and late admission (> 48 h)]. 

The level of significance was set at 0.05 (two-tailed). 
No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. All 
analyses were performed using IBM SPSS version 26.0 
(IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R version 4.1.1 (R 
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 

Results 

Between 5 February 2020 and 21 December 2021, 6225 
patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 55 ICUs. We 
included 4076 patients in this analysis, 133 (3%) of whom 
presented a community-acquired respiratory coinfection 
(Supplementary Fig. 1). 

Demographics and characteristics 

Patient characteristics at hospital admission are reported 
in Table 1. Patients without bacterial coinfection presented 
less comorbidities than patient with coinfection 
(45 vs. 55%; p = 
0.019). Time from symptoms onset to 
ICU admission and from hospital to ICU admission were 
both shorter for the bacterial coinfection group. At hospital 
admission, patients with bacterial coinfection had 
lower PaO2/FiO2 ratio [200 (105; 277) vs. 165 (100; 237; 
0.017)] and they were more likely to undergo invasive 
mechanical ventilation (12 vs. 44%; p < 0.001); they also 
had higher leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts. 

Only 10 patients out of the 133 with bacterial coinfection 
received an empirical antibiotic treatment before 
hospital admission. 

Supplementary Table 3 reports data on antibiotic prescription, 
with 74% of patients without bacterial coinfection 
receiving antibiotics within the first 48 h from 
hospital admission. 

Data on microorganisms isolated in the coinfection 
group are displayed in Supplementary Table 4. The most 
commonly found bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus, 
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 

Supplementary Table 5 reports data on the sampling 
techniques used to isolate the microorganisms responsible 
for the bacterial coinfections. 

Primary outcome 

In our population, median values of PCT [0.19 (0.1; 0.44) 
vs. 0.26 (0.12; 0.94) ng/mL; p = 
0.01] and CRP [131 (70; 

213) vs. 163 (109; 242) mg/L; p < 0.001] were significantly 
higher in the bacterial coinfection group (Table 1). 
In order to determine the best PCT and CRP values 
to identify bacterial coinfection, we analysed different 
cut-off points from the receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve, resulting in PCT = 
0.12 ng/mL and 
CRP = 
97 mg/L being the best thresholds to identify 
bacterial coinfection with a sensitivity higher than 80% 
(Table 2); both biomarkers had low AUC scores at the 
ROC curve analysis [0.57 (95% CI 0.51–0.61) and 0.6 
(95% CI, 0.55–0.64) for PCT and CRP, respectively] (Supplementary 
Fig. 2), but high NPV [97.5% (95% CI 96.5– 

98.5) and 98.2% (95% CI 97.5–98.9) for PCT and CRP, 
respectively] (Table 2). 
In the multivariable models we analysed the association 
between single biomarkers levels or their combination 
and bacterial coinfection. In Model 1 PCT = 
0.12 was not 
associated with coinfection (OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.69–1.79; 
p = 
0.659), while a significance was detected both for 
CRP alone and, in model 2, for the combination of the 
two biomarkers (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.25–3.19; p = 
0.004 and 
OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.15–2.56; p = 
0.008 for CRP in Model 
1 and for the combination of PCT and CRP in Model 2) 
(Table 3). 

Secondary outcome 

The overall 15, 30 and 90 days mortality had a higher 
trend in the bacterial coinfection group, but without significant 
difference, as shown in Supplementary Table 6. In 
the multivariable models assessing predictors of 30 days 
mortality neither PCT = 
0.12 ng/mL nor CRP = 
97 mg/L 
showed a significant association with higher mortality 
(OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.97–1.40; p = 
0.094 and OR 1.02, 95% 
CI 0.87–1.19; p = 
0.839 for PCT and CRP respectively) 
(Supplementary Table 7), while for the 90-day mortality 
a positive signal was only detected for PCT (OR 1.2, 95% 
CI 1.03–1.4; p = 
0.022)(Supplementary Table 8).

subgroup analysis considering non-respiratory SOFA 
score and the presence of septic shock. 

The analysis of the cut-off points from the ROC curves 
was repeated, in order to identify the biomarkers thresholds 
with an 80% sensitivity for bacterial coinfection. 

In patients presenting septic shock at hospital admission, 
levels of PCT = 
0.11 ng/mL where associated with 
bacterial coinfection, but with a very wide confidence 
interval (OR 81.1, 95% CI 1.71–3850.77; p = 
0.026) 
(Table 4 and Supplementary Table 9). At the ROC curve 
analysis for identification of bacterial coinfection, PCT 
had an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI 0.67–0.98) in patients with 
septic shock (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3). 

Conversely, in patients with a non-respiratory 
SOFA = 
2, only CRP > 107 mg/L was associated with bacterial 
coinfection (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.08–4.75; p = 
0.03) 
(Table 4 and Supplementary Table 10), but with an AUC 
of 0.6 (95% CI 0.53–0.67) at the ROC curve analysis 
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4). CRP was also associated 
with bacterial coinfection in patients without septic 
shock (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.24–3.51; p = 
0.006) and with a 
non-respiratory SOFA < 2 (OR 3.18, 95% CI 1.32–7.62;

Finally, acknowledging differences in PCT and CRP 
kinetics, we explored the potential correlation between 
time since symptoms onset and biomarkers values. 

Supplementary Fig. 5 displays differences in PCT and 
CRP values at hospital admission, stratified according 
to time from symptoms onset. In patients with bacteria 
coinfection presenting symptoms from < 3 days, PCT had 
higher values (p =

populations, coinfected patients had higher PCT and 
CRP in the = 
48 h group (PCT p = 
0.001, CRP p = 
0.027), 
while in the > 48 h group an increase from the baseline 
was shown only for CRP values (p = 
0.001). 

In the multivariable models for association with bacterial 
coinfection we found no significant association 
between biomarkers thresholds and bacterial coinfection, 
but with a positive trend for PCT = 
0.44 ng/mL in the 
early symptoms group (OR 14.97; 95% CI 0.96–234.03; 
p = 
0.054)(Table 4 and Supplementary Table 11). At the 
ROC curve analysis for identification of bacterial coinfection, 
PCT had an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.61–0.92) in the 
group with = 
48 h since symptoms onset (Fig. 1 and Supplementary 
Fig. 6). 

Discussion 

In this large cohort of critically ill patient with COVID19 
we found that the combined values of PCT and CRP 
upon admission, as well as CRP values alone, were associated 
with bacterial respiratory coinfection. 

However, our results suggest that a single determination 
of these biomarkers is not enough to identify a 

bacterial coinfection, as their significance should always 
be contextualized with a thorough clinical evaluation 
[29]. 

In our population, the incidence of bacterial coinfection 
was 3% and the more commonly isolated bacteria 
were S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, consistently with the 
previous studies [4–6]. 

Although PCT and CRP alone had low accuracy in 
predicting bacterial coinfection based on the ROC curve 
analysis (AUC of 0.57 and 0.6 for PCT and CRP, respectively), 
likely due to low specificity, our study found that 
CRP alone and the combination of PCT and CRP were 
still associated with bacterial coinfection in the multivariable 
model. Moreover, the identified biomarkers thresholds 
demonstrated a sensitivity greater than 80% and 
high negative predictive values, suggesting that values of 
PCT < 0.12 ng/mL and CRP < 97 mg/L may still be useful 
to rule out bacterial coinfection, similarly to what was 
found by Ingram et al. in patients with severe 2009 H1N1 
influenza infection [30]. Notably, in order to address the 
possible bias created by the derivation of thresholds values 
and evaluation of diagnostic test accuracy in the same 
population, we reported commonly used biomarkers cutoffs 
in Table 2, showing the consistency of our thresholds 
[31–33]. 

When interpreting these results it is important to 
consider that serum CRP is an acute-phase protein and 
it rises whenever an inflammatory process is present 
[34]. In a recent study it was found that high CRP levels

were a good predictor of CAP in patient with clinical 
diagnosis and false-negative chest X-ray, confirming 
that very high levels of this biomarker are more specific 
for bacterial infection [35, 36]. Nevertheless, its serum 
concentration depends on the intensity of the stimulus 
and, at the early stage of COVID-19, CRP levels were 
found to be positively correlated with lung lesions [37]. 
Procalcitonin conversely has higher sensitivity and 
specificity as compared to CRP for differentiating bacterial 
from viral infections [38]. 

Clearly a single biomarker could never capture the 
complex and variable interactions of an infection and 
its values should be interpreted in light of the overall 
clinical context [29]; in order to evaluate the clinical 

usefulness of PCT and CRP, we therefore assessed the 
association between biomarkers and bacterial coinfection 
in patients with an higher risk profile for coinfection. 
We found an association between values of 
PCT = 
0.11 ng/mL and bacterial coinfection in patients 
presenting septic shock, with a very wide confidence 
interval (OR 81.1, 95% CI 1.71–3850.77; p = 
0.026) but 
with an AUC of 0.82 at the ROC curve analysis. Conversely, 
CRP was associated with bacterial coinfection 
in various subgroups throughout the models (no sep-
tic shock, non-respiratory SOFA both under and over 
2), but always with low AUC scores. These results are 
in favour of a stronger connection between PCT levels 
and bacterial coinfection, while CRP seems to have 

a lower discriminatory ability [31, 38, 39]. However, 
given the high number of variables we adjusted for and 
the small sample size of the subgroups, these analysis 
have low statistical power and must be discussed with 
caution. 

When considering symptoms timing, in particular the 
first 48 h since symptoms onset, we found that PCT had 
an AUC of 0.76 (95% CI 0.61–0.92), with no significant 
association but with a positive trend between bacterial 
coinfection and values of PCT = 
0.44 ng/mL, suggesting 
improved discrimination abilities in the first hours since 
symptoms onset and the possible application of an higher 
cut off as already proposed by Bouadma et al. [35] in the 
PRORATA trial. 

The importance of taking into account the kinetics of 
PCT and CRP has already been stated by Méndez et al. 
[18], who showed that the inflammatory response at the 
time of CAP diagnosis was influenced by the time since 
symptoms onset, with a greater expression of PCT in 
the first 2 days and slower kinetics for CRP. Our results 
may agree with their conclusions, suggesting how PCT 
could be a more reliable indicator in the initial phase of 
infection. 

According to the meta-analysis of Langford et al. 

[7] during the COVID-19 pandemic there has been 
a reckless use of antibiotics: they were prescribed in 
three-quarters of patients and, given the low rate of coinfections, 
most of them were unnecessarily administered. 
In our study the number of patients treated with antibiotics 
was accordingly high, with 74% rate of administration 
in patients without bacterial coinfection within the first 
48 h from hospital admission. In light of these results, 
finding a way to predict the presence of bacterial coinfection 
at hospital admission becomes even more crucial, to 
improve antibiotic stewardship and picture the possible 
outcomes. 
In our population patients with a bacterial coinfection 
were admitted earlier to the ICU and had longer ICU 
stay, reflecting the increased severity of the disease. Mortality 
had a higher trend in coinfected patients (15 days 
mortality 11 vs 15%, 30 days mortality 22 vs 26%, 90 days 
mortality 31 vs 37%, respectively in not coinfected and 
coinfected patients), but without significant differences. 
In our opinion these result may be linked to several factors: 
first of all the high rate of antibiotic treatment at 
hospital admission in the coinfected group, therefore the 
high number of patients appropriately treated; secondly, 
treated bacterial coinfections may not have had a more 
significant impact on mortality than other complications, 
as age, comorbidities, immunosuppression, lack of 
knowledge and resources reportedly had, especially during 
the first two waves on the pandemic. In the multivariable 
models neither PCT nor CRP were associated with 

30 days mortality, but PCT = 
0.12 ng/mL was associated 
with 90 days mortality, showing an overall positive trend, 
accordingly to what already found by Carbonell et al. [40]. 

Major strengths of this study include its multicentre 
nature, the consecutive inclusion of all patients from 
each intensive care unit, the high number of patients analysed 
and long-term follow-up. We also considered antibiotics 
administered previously of hospital admission: we 
excluded from the no bacterial coinfection group patients 
that had been taking antibiotics, in order to avoid the 
inclusion in this group of those with an appropriately 
treated bacterial coinfection. 

We acknowledge the presence of some limitations 
that should be taken into account. First of all, the poor 
sensitivity and incomplete use of diagnostic tests, that 
represent a critical barrier to coinfection detection and 
antibiotic stewardship [41]. It has been reported that 
identification of the pathogen responsible for community-
acquired pneumonia may be elusive, with less than 
50% of cases having a confirmed aetiology [42, 43]. In 
our population bacterial coinfection was more common 
in patients intubated at hospital admission, which could 
be due to illness severity SOFA < 2 but also to a more 
invasive sampling strategy. By limiting the inclusion in 
the bacterial coinfection group to patient with a microbiologically 
confirmed aetiology, we might have misclassified 
some no-coinfected patient and created a bias. 
However, this limitation did not affect haemocultures 
and urinary antigens testing and the prevalence of bacterial 
coinfection observed in our population is similar to 
that reported in the previous studies [4, 5, 30]. Second, 
we didn’t include radiological evidence and data on the 
microbiological work-up in our analysis, as the CIBERESUCICOVID 
database was not designed to register these 
information. However, radiological evidences were taken 
into account by clinicians at the time of diagnosis of the 
bacterial coinfection. 

Third, in the subgroup analysis we considered the variable 
“time since symptoms onset”, which is necessarily 
self-reported, dependent on the subjective perception of 
symptoms and therefore susceptible to bias; however, the 
exact onset of symptoms is not otherwise objectifiable for 
a community-acquired infection [18]. 

Fourth, we acknowledge limitations associated to the 
retrospective design of the study and the plausible influence 
on our results of selecting patients from different 
waves of the pandemic, as well as those connected to 
the observational nature of the study and missing data. 
Particularly, in our population the rate of missing values 
was higher for PCT when compared with CRP, as the former 
is not routinely measured. The impact of PCT-based 
algorithms on antibiotic sparing, and therefore their 

cost-effectiveness, is still debated [11]; the decision to 
measure PCT is normally based on the clinician request, 
introducing a possible bias in observational studies 
involving this biomarker. However, we have adjusted all 
of our analyses for these confounders. 

Finally, our results bring new interesting aspects to 
the interpretation of biomarkers in the context of bacterial 
coinfection, but they refer to COVID-19 patients and 
may not be applicable in other clinical settings. 

Conclusions 

Our study suggests that measurements of PCT and CRP, 
alone and at a single time point, are unfortunately not 
useful for ruling in or out bacterial coinfection in viral 
pneumonia by COVID-19. 

Considering the combined values of these biomarkers, 
as well as symptoms timing and the broader clinical 
context, appears to be relevant in their interpretation and 
therefore in the design of further studies.
