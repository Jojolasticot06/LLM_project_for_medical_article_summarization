Background in Brazil as Integrative and Complementary Practices 
The expression Traditional, Complementary and Integra-in Health and was implemented in the Unified Health 
tive Medicine, coined by the WHO [1], is known locally System (SUS) through a 2006’s National Law, revised in 
2018, that defines 29 practices officially recognized in the 
scope of the health system [2, 3]. The Brazilian private health system is optional to their citizens and regulated by the National Health Supplementary Agency, reimbursing only homeopathy and acupuncture [4]. In order 
to compare the results with the international literature 
we will use the term Complementary and Alternative 
Medicine (CAM) in this study. 

CAM in Brazil originates from complex systems such 
as Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Ayurveda and can be 
organized according to treatment methods, which in this 
case are herbal medicine and medicinal plants, manual 
care (acupuncture, chiropractic, osteopathy, massage), 
body-mind therapies (tai chi chuan, yoga, lian gong, 
meditation, bioenergetics) or support group therapy such 
as the Brazilian methodology known as integrative community 
therapy [5]. 

It is essential to state that indigenous and traditional 
medicines are not enrolled in the Brazilian CAM definition. 
The main reason for this is that indigenous public 
health care in Brazil has a specific primary care model for 
indigenous populations through multidisciplinary health 
teams and is organized together with indigenous authorities 
as a subsystem [5]. 

Worldwide, the prevalence of CAM use in the general 
population can range from 10 to 75% [6]. The Brazilian 
National Health Survey (PNS) is undertaken every 
5 years and considering data from the 2013 edition we 
observed that more than seven million adults reported 
using CAM, representing a prevalence of 4.5% [7]. When 
comparing the PNS data with those from other countries, 
we can observe variability in prevalence estimates: in the 
United States, the prevalence of CAM use was 33%, in 
Germany, it was 40%, and in Malaysia, it was 56% [7–9]. 
Thus, this article aims to estimate the prevalence of CAM 
use in the Brazilian adult population in 2019, and analyze 
factors associated with CAM use in Brazil. 

Methods 

Study design, objective, and sampling 

This study is a cross-sectional survey using a representative 
sample of the Brazilian adult population residing 
in permanent households in Brazil, the 2019 National 
Health Survey (PNS-2019). We obtained the secondary 
data from the “Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística” 
regarding the “CAM use” chapter from PNS [10]. 

The PNS-2019 sample consisted of clusters in three 
stages, with stratification of census tracts (primary sampling 
units - PSU), where, first, the Primary Analysis Unit 
were randomly selected, followed by random selection of 
a fixed number of permanent households. Finally, a resident 
over 15 years of age or older was randomly selected 
in that household from a list of eligible residents. Trained 
interviewers collected data using a structured questionnaire. 
The survey had three questionnaires, one for the 
selected resident, one for the household information, and 
the other to collect data about all residents [11]. We used 

data only for the 18 years old and above for the present 
study. 

The PNS-2019 visited 108,525 households (with a nonresponse 
rate of 8.1%), and 94,114 interviews were carried 
out (with a non-response rate of 6.4%).[Since this is 
a sample with a complex design, expansion factors were 
calculated, including correction factors for losses, followed 
by weighing and calibration based on population 
projections. 

Outcome and associated variables 

For this study, the outcome was the use of one or more 
Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) in the 
last 12 months, which was obtained through the question: 
“In the last twelve months, (interviewer’s name) 
used treatments such as acupuncture, homeopathy, 
medicinal plants and herbal medicine, meditation, yoga, 
Tai chi chuan, Lian gong or any other integrative and 
complementary health practice?”. No previous definition 
of what was meant by integrative and complementary 
practice was provided to the interviewed person. 

For the subjects who answered this question positively, 
additional questions were asked to detail which CAM 
was (were) used, namely: Acupuncture, Homeopathy, 
Medicinal Plants, Meditation, Yoga, Tai chi chuan (or 
Lian gong, or Qi gong), Community Therapy, or others. 
Multiple responses were possible. The answers were considered 
individually and later computed to identify how 
many CAM modalities among the listed were used by 
each respondent. 

The per capita income variable was calculated and 
converted to the Brazilian minimum wage. In 2019, the 
minimum wage in Brazil was R$998.00. This amount 
was divided by the exchange rate to USD in that same 
year ($3.946) to make the correspondence of Brazilian 
minimal wage in USD. We then categorized into up to 
$126.46 (equivalent to up to ½ minimum wages -MW), 
over $136.46 and up to $252.91 (over ½ MW and up to 
1MW) - Over $252.91 and up to $502 .8 (More than 
1MW and up to 2MW) - More than $502.83 (More 
than 2 MW). 

The covariates used in this study were the Brazilian 
regions in which the respondent lives, sex (male, 
female), age group (18–39, 40–59, 60 or older), educational 
level (complete elementary school, complete high 
school, university degree or more), per capita income 
(up to ½, more than 1/2 and up to 1, more than one up 
to 2, and more than two minimum wages -MW), color/ 
race (non-white and white), self-assessment in health 
(good/very good, fair/bad/very bad), use of private 
health insurance (no, yes), and access to health care in 
the last 12 months (no, yes). 


We assessed the access to healthcare using the question: 
“When did (interviewee’s name) last see a doctor?” 
The answer options were: “Up to one year” (we 
considered yes, had access to health), “more than one 
year to 2 years” (we considered as no, did not have 
access to health), “more than two years to 3 years” (we 
considered as no, did not have access to health), “more 
than three years” (we considered as no, did not have 
access to health), and “never went to the doctor” (we 
considered as no, did not have access to health). This 
variable is a proxy for access to the healthcare systemas 
defined by Boccolini and Souza-Junior (2016) [12]. 

Initially, we estimated the prevalence of CAM use 
(one or more CAMs) by categories of sociodemographic 
characteristics, self-assessment in health, and 
access to health services. Then, we estimated the association 
between exposure covariates and the primary 
outcome (use of one or more CAMs) employing a generalized 
linear model with a logistic link function and 
a 99% confidence interval. 

In the next step, the prevalence and confidence 
intervals of 99% of use of the five most frequently used 
CAMs (Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Medicinal Plants, 
Meditation, Yoga) were estimated, according to the 
categories of the covariates or exposure variables, with 
a confidence interval 99%. 

The least used CAMs, such as Integrative and Community 
Therapy, Tai chi or Lian gong, or Qi gong and 
Auriculotherapy, were not tabulated. 

Then, generalized linear models were estimated, 
with logistic link function, 99% confidence interval, 
and 1% alpha, with one model estimated for each of 
the four most used CAMs and another model for those 
who used one or more CAMs. All covariates or expo-
sure variables were considered concomitantly in these 
models, regardless of their statistical significance level. 

In all stages, we considered the sample weights and 
the complex design of the sample. All analyses were 
conducted using the R version 3.6.0 program. 

Finally, to compare the prevalence of CAM use in 
2019, we used the previously estimated CAM prevalence 
data from the 2013 National Health Survey 
(PNS-2013) [13], incorporating the complex sample 
design. Since the previous publication about CAM 
use in Brazil in 2013 used a 95% confidence interval, 
we decided to use the same confidence interval in the 
2019 analysis to compare the prevalence evolution. In 
the PNS-2013 edition, the participants reported only 
acupuncture, homeopathy, and medicinal and herbal 
plants (further details in Boccolini & Boccolini, 2020) 
[13], limiting the comparison with the PNS - 2019 
edition. CAM utilization data from PNS-2013 were 
compared with those from PNS-2019, considering 

differences in point prevalence and the absence of 
interpolation of the 95% confidence intervals. 

Results 

The prevalence of CAM use in Brazil in 2019 was 5.2% 
(CI99% = 
4.8–5.6%), being higher in the North and South 
macro-regions, among female individuals, with higher 
education, higher income, in older age groups, and of 
white color/race. The CAM use prevalence was higher 
among individuals who reported a worse health situation, 
had a private health plan, and had greater healthcare 
access (Table 1). 

In adjusted analyses, individuals from the South, 
Northeast, and North regions were more likely to report 
CAM use when compared to individuals from the Southeast 
region. No differences in CAM use in the Mid-West 
region, compared to other regions, were found. Higher 
chances of CAM use were also found among women, 
with complete higher education, per capita family income 
greater than two minimum wages, and aged 40 years or 
more when compared to the reference categories (male 
sex, complete elementary school, up to half the minimum 
wage and between 18 and 39 years of age). Reporting 
worse health status, having a private health insurance 
plan, and access to healthcare are also associated with 
greater CAM use (Table 2). 

According to sociodemographic and health characteristics, 
Table 3 shows the prevalence of the types of CAM most 
frequently used by the Brazilian population (acupuncture, 
homeopathy, medicinal plants, meditation, and yoga). The 
prevalence distribution followed a similar pattern according 
to the region of residence, being higher in the South and 
Southeast regions, except medicinal plants, which showed 
a higher prevalence of use in the North and Northeast 
regions. We found higher prevalence of CAM use among 
females, higher income levels, education, and access to 
health care for all CAMs. Higher prevalence of acupuncture, 
homeopathy and medicinal plants were also found 
among individuals aged 60years and over, and meditation 
and yoga among younger people (up to 59years of age). 

The prevalence of use of integrative community therapy 
was 0.09% (0.06–0.15), tai-chi (lian gong, qi gong) 
was 0.06% (0.03–0.13), and auriculotherapy was 0.35% 
(0.27–0.46), non-tabulated data. 

White color/race individuals also showed a higher 
prevalence of CAM use, except for medicinal plants 
(Table 4). Acupuncture and medicinal plants were frequent 
among individuals with a report of poor health, 
while homeopathy, meditation, and yoga were more 
frequent among those with a report of better health. 
In the multivariate analyses, the use of CAM was associated 
with female gender, higher education, older age

Table 5 shows the prevalence of acupuncture, homeopathy, 
medicinal plants, and the use of at least one 
CAM for the years 2013 and 2019. The primary trend 
is an increase in prevalence among the sociodemographic 
variables evaluated in the period. However, 
there is stability in the prevalence of CAM in the 
South and homeopathy in the Northeast region. It is 
also observed that there is stability in the use of CAMs 
among individuals with lower educational levels and 
the use of homeopathy among those of non-white 
color/race. Homeopathy and all CAM use decreased 
in the South region. There was also a decrease in the 
prevalence of medicinal plants use in the South and 

North region. There was also a slight decrease in the 
use of medicinal plants among non-white individuals 
(Table 5). 

Discussion 

Based on our findings, we extrapolated the results and 
estimated that 8,500,000 Brazilian adults over 18years 
old reported using one or more CAM in 2019, equivalent 
to 5.2% of the country’s population, an increase of 0.7% in 
the prevalence of CAM use compared to the PNS-2013 
research. Medicinal plants were the most frequently used 
CAMs in Brazil, with substantial regional differences: 
while in the Southeast, a more industrialized and urbanized 
Brazilian region, the use of acupuncture was more 
frequent, in the Northeast and North regions, that con-
tains most of the Amazon Forest, the use of medicinal 
plants was more frequently reported by the population. 
The Brazilian Middle-West region has less population 
and comprises most of Brazilian crops and cattle, having 
worse healthcare access than the Southeast and South

regions. No differences in CAM use were found in the 
PNS-2019 study when comparing this region with the 
others. This heterogeneity was maintained when comparing 
these findings with those of the PNS-2013. 

Brazil has five regions, with significant sociodemographic 
and health differences between them. The South 
and Southeast regions are the most densely populated 
and economically developed, with better health indicators, 
better access to health services [14], and longer life 
expectancy [15] than the North, Northeast, and Midwest 
regions. The North region concentrates more than 
80% of the indigenous population [16], likely influencing 
the higher prevalence of medicinal plants. Paradoxically, 
the North region has the lowest offer of CAM in 
primary health care [13]. Indigenous practices and their 
cosmological perspectives are not incorporated into 
the Brazilian Policy on Integrative and Complementary 
Health Practices of the Unified Health System and other 
practices such as prayers, healers, and midwives [17]. In 
Brazil, the discussion about the insertion of these traditional 
practices into policies is still incipient and has not 
received adequate research support, so we do not know 
what percentage of the population seeks this type of care 
[18]. We can assume that if these practices were incorporated 
into the PNS questionnaire, the prevalence of CAM 
would be even higher in Brazil. 

The present study also observed that female individuals 
with complete higher education, per capita family income 
higher than two minimum wages (more than $502.83), or 
aged 40 years or more were more likely to use one or more 
CAM. This profile of CAM use is similar to that observed 
in the United States, Swiss and Australia [18–21]. According 
to the PNS 2019, the demand for health services, in 
general, was higher among older women with a high level 
of education [21]. Some studies have shown that women 
with higher educational levels and wealthier use more frequently 
CAM [9, 22, 23], especially at different stages of 
life, such as during pregnancy, postpartum to climacteric, 
and menopause [24, 25]. 

The present study observed that individuals with better 
access to health care are more likely to use CAM, and 
in the adjusted analysis, it was possible to observe that 
these individuals were more likely to use acupuncture, 
homeopathy, and yoga. These findings suggest possible 
inequalities in access to health services, as these practices 
require specialized professionals who might not be available 
in the Brazilian Unified Health System. In the PNS 
- 
2013, it was observed that acupuncture and homeopathy 
are among the most used CAMs by those who had a 
private health plan [13]. In PNS- 2019 the use of CAM 
among private health plan users was 47% higher than 
among non-users. However, it was not possible to evaluate 
if CAM was funded by the healthcare (direct use or 

reimbursement), by the public health system (SUS), out 
of pocket, or a combination of those possibilities. In 
Brazil, private healthcare users can usufruct the public 
health system facilities and services. 

There is still a mismatch between the supply and 
use of CAM, especially within the Unified Health System. 
The Ministry of Health of Brazil [26] reports an 
increase in the supply of CAM in the Unified Health 
System across the country. However, the use of CAM 
through the Unified Health System is still relatively 
low [5, 13, 27]. Studies have shown that the offer in 
Brazil is dependent on health professionals; that is, 
there is no specific financing, and the offer depends 
most on the willingness of the health professional to 
offer CAM services [27]. Thus, practices that require 
specific inputs (such as acupuncture) and higher specialization, 
such as Acupuncture and Homeopathy (a 
specialty restricted to medical activity in Brazil), continue 
to be offered less, even after 15 years of National 
Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices 
implementation [27]. 

Regarding self-rated health, the present survey 
observed that individuals who reported having regular, 
poor, or very poor health are more likely to use CAM 
compared to those who reported having better health 
status. In the evaluation by type of CAM, it was also possible 
to observe that those who declared a worse health 
situation are more likely to use acupuncture or medicinal 
plants. Similar results associating worse health status 
and greater use of CAM were observed in other studies 
[9, 19, 28]. Having a private health insurance plan also 
increased the chances of using CAM, and similar findings 
were found in other surveys [17, 29, 30]. 

Meditation, yoga, tai chi chuan (or lian gong or qi 
gong), integrative community therapy, and auriculotherapy 
are CAM were not included in the PNS- 2013 and 
were included in 2019 after insertion in the National 
Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices. The 
present study observed a low prevalence of tai chi chuan 
(or lian gong or qi gong), and integrative community 
therapy. Meditation and yoga also had a low prevalence 
use among Brazilian adults. A population survey conducted 
in the United States found a prevalence of 8.9% 
in yoga among adults, but in the United Kingdom, this 
prevalence was lower at 1.1% [31, 32]. Regarding meditation, 
a survey conducted in the United States found a 
prevalence of 18.6% in adults [33]. 

The yoga and meditation profile practice stood out in 
the PNS-2019 among female individuals with private 
health insurance, access to health services, and reported 
better self-rated health. Individuals with complete higher 
education were more than ten times more likely to use 
these two CAM types than others. We can observe that 

these are types of CAM used by individuals with higher 
incomes. Similar results for yoga were observed in studies 
conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom, 
and Germany [30, 31]. 

In Brazil, studies about the prevalence of the practice 
of yoga and meditation are still scarce; however, these 
practices are understood as a form of health promotion, 
disease prevention, and even as a therapeutic action, 
thus being adopted by the Unified Health System 
within the scope of primary care in health [34]. Yoga 
and meditation are the CAM with the fastest-growing 
supply in the country, with a more than 200% increase 
in the number of services and the one with the highest 
number of services offered per capita (2.20/100000 
inhabitant) [5]. 

An extensive systematic review reported a variability 
by which CAMs are defined and classified in studies [6], 
making it difficult to compare the use of these practices 
across populations. The type of sampling and the target 
population is a factor that can influence research results. 
Several studies focus on specific populations or subjects, 
which can generate an overestimation of CAM use. An 
example is the high prevalence of CAM use in studies 
with individuals with specific illnesses (especially chronic 
or terminal illnesses), while we find lower prevalence in 
population-based studies such as the Brazilian PNS-2013 
[25, 35, 36]. 

Regarding the study limitations, the lack of definition 
of CAM provided by the interviewer might lead to information 
bias since the interviewee might not correlate a 
usual practice or therapy with the CAM term used in the 
questionnaire [37, 38], which might result in the underestimation 
of CAM use. Also, the respondents may not 
remember the use of CAM in the last 12 months, resulting 
in a small recall bias. In the PNS-2019, a “filter” question 
was asked in which the respondent had the option 
of answering “yes” or “no” for the use of eight CAMs 
previously listed, and if the answer was “yes” to the use 
of these CAMs, the subsequent questions about each of 
the eight CAMs were carried out separately. This procedure 
may have underestimated the prevalence of CAM 
use in Brazil, which could have been avoided if all eight 
CAMs selected by the research coordination were read 
in sequence, allowing the respondent to respond positively 
or negatively to each type of CAM separately. However, 
as Unified Health System offers 29 types of CAM, 
we believe that including all of them in the survey would 
possibly reduce the information bias, which could reflect 
a higher prevalence of the use of these therapies. 

Another limitation of the study was the non-assessment 
of the out-of-pocket amount for the use of CAM. 
Unlike the PNS-2013 analyses, it was impossible to 
know whether the individual used CAM by Unified 

Health System, health insurance, or private funding. 
The PNS - 
2019 questionnaire did not cover this information. 
On the other hand, the strength of the research 
was its population representation, having reached 
adults from all socioeconomic strata and allowing the 
generalization of the results. 

Conclusion 

The use of CAM is heterogeneous, with essential differences 
in the patterns of use between Brazilian 
regions. Cultural issues can explain these differences 
and aspects related to the supply and access to health 
services that provide CAM. Wealthier populations with 
higher education and access to private health plans use 
CAM more often that depend on supplies and specialized 
health professionals, such as acupuncture and 
homeopathy. The poorest part of the population and 
with less education use medicinal herbs and herbal 
medicines more frequently, which have easier access 
and can often be used without the guidance of health 
professionals.
