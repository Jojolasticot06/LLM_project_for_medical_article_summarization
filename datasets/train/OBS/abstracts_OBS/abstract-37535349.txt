OBJECTIVE: To assess oral HPV prevalence and factors associated with HR and 
low-risk infection in a general US population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: PROGRESS (Prevalence of Oral HPV Infection, a 
Global Assessment) was a cross-sectional observational study conducted between 
November 2021 and March 2022 in 43 dental offices in the US (24 urban, 13 urban 
cluster, and 6 rural sites), spanning 21 states. Eligible participants were aged 
18 to 60 years, visiting dental clinics for routine dental examination. Dental 
clinics used targeted sampling to recruit equal distributions of men and women 
and across age groups.
EXPOSURE: Participants provided an oral gargle specimen for HPV DNA and 
genotyping and completed behavioral questionnaires, and dentists reported oral 
health status. Detection of HPV DNA and genotyping was performed using the 
SPF10/DEIA/LiPA25 system at a central laboratory.
MAIN OUTCOME: Oral HPV prevalence.
RESULTS: Of the 3196 participants enrolled, mean (SD) age was 39.6 (12.1) years, 
and 55.5% were women. Oral HPV prevalence was 6.6% (95% CI, 5.7%-7.4%) for any 
HPV genotype, and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.5%-2.5%), 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%), and 1.5% 
(95% CI, 1.1%-1.9%) for HR, HPV-16, and 9-valent-HPV vaccine types, 
respectively. Among HPV-positive participants, HPV-16 was the most prevalent 
genotype (12.4% among men and 8.6% among women). Prevalence of HPV was higher in 
men than women and highest among men aged 51 to 60 years (16.8%, 6.8%, and 2.1% 
for any HPV, HR HPV, and HPV-16, respectively). Factors associated with HR oral 
infection included being male (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2-8.5), 
being aged 51 to 60 years (AOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.3), having 26 or more 
lifetime male sex partners (AOR, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.3-18.7), and having 6 to 25 
lifetime female oral sex partners (AOR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3-8.7).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, oral HPV burden was 
highest among older men who may be at higher risk of developing oropharyngeal 
cancer. In addition to male sex and older age, HR oral HPV infection was also 
associated with sexual behaviors, including increasing number of male sex 
partners and female oral sex partners.
