Introduction 

Diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy (DSPN) affects individuals 
with diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance and/or impaired 
fasting glucose and is characterised by demyelination and 
axonal loss of peripheral sensory and motor nerves [1]. 
Despite the significant advances in elucidating the underlying 
pathogenesis of DSPN, the condition remains underdiagnosed 
and undertreated in clinical practice and poses major challenges 
in clinical trials [2, 3]. On the one hand, a delayed diagnosis may 
foster irreversible neuropathic damage, hamper suitable interventions 
and increase the risk of associated disabilities and 
medical costs. On the other hand, the early detection of subclinical 
or asymptomatic DSPN with electrophysiological or quantitative 
sensory testing, which could allow for early intervention 
[4], is time-consuming, expensive, requires expertise and is only 
accessible in specialised centres. Thus, there is an increased need 


for simple, easy-to-perform, inexpensive biomarker measurements 
that can provide clinical information that reasonably 
reflect early DSPN detected and monitored by peripheral nerve 
function tests. Beyond difficulties in diagnosis and management, 
developing new disease-modifying treatments for DSPN is an 
unmet need, as underlined by numerous failed phase 3 trials [5]. 
A fundamental reason for these unsuccessful trials is the lack of 
reproducible and accurate surrogate endpoints predicting the 
ultimate clinical endpoints such as foot ulceration and amputation 
[2]. Clinical symptoms and neurological deficits are subjective 
and, consequently, they have poor reproducibility [6], while 
electrophysiological studies represent US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved objective surrogate endpoints 
[7], albeit their reproducibility has been questioned because of 
high inter-observer variability [6]. 

Therefore, there is a pressing demand to identify and validate 
novel biomarkers to monitor DSPN and facilitate drug 
discovery. Ideally, these biomarkers should be blood-based 
and easy to measure to expedite their implementation in the 
clinical setting. Additionally, their measurement should be 
objective, reproducible and accurate to allow their use as 
biomarkers for the progression of DSPN in clinical trials. 

The neurofilament light chain (NFL) is a cytoskeletal 
component of mature neurons that provides structural stability 
and determines axonal diameter [8, 9]. NFL is more abundant 
in large myelinated axons facilitating a faster conduction velocity. 
Upon axonal injury, NFL is released from axons into the 
circulation [10]. The efficacy of serum NFL as a biomarker of 
neuroaxonal damage emerged initially in multiple sclerosis, 
where it serves for prognosis and treatment monitoring [10, 
11]. Currently, there is growing scientific evidence associating 
serum NFL with other neurodegenerative diseases [12]and 
peripheral neuropathies in humans [13–25] and animals 
[26–28]. However, evidence of a potential association between 
NFL and DSPN is scarce. One recent preliminary study indicated 
inverse correlations between serum NFL and some nerve 
function measures in individuals with type 2 diabetes who had 
a known diabetes duration of 3 years or less [29]. An earlier 
study reported higher blood NFL (also known as NEFL) 
mRNA levels in people with impaired glucose tolerance and/ 
or impaired fasting glucose and peripheral neuropathy than 
those without [30]. However, whether serum NFL is associated 
with prevalent DSPN in individuals with type 1 or type 2 
diabetes of a very short known duration remains unknown. 

Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to 
investigate associations of serum NFL with prevalent DSPN 
and peripheral nerve function in recently diagnosed type 1 and 
type 2 diabetes. We hypothesised that higher serum NFL 
levels are associated with prevalent DSPN and nerve dysfunction. 
Given that we measured serum NFL with proximity 
extension assay technology in a 92-biomarker panel, the 
secondary aim of our study was to explore potential associations 
of other biomarkers in this panel with DSPN. 

Methods 

Study design and study population The German Diabetes 
Study (GDS) is an ongoing observational prospective study 
that evaluates the natural course of recently diagnosed diabetes 
and explores prognostic factors and mechanisms leading to 
diabetes-related complications [31]. Individuals aged 18–69 
years at the baseline examination with a known diabetes duration 
of less than 1 year are eligible to participate, while individuals 
with overt neurological diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, 
dementia or psychiatric disorders, are excluded. 
Diabetes is diagnosed according to the ADA criteria [32]. At 
baseline, all participants undergo a comprehensive examination 
consisting of clinical tests, a face-to-face interview, 
standardised written questionnaires and detailed laboratory 
measurements. 

The GDS is conducted according to the Declaration of 
Helsinki, approved by the ethics committee of Heinrich 
Heine University, Düsseldorf, Germany (ref. 4508) and was 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration no. 
NCT01055093). All participants provided written informed 
consent. 

This cross-sectional analysis focused on 503 participants 
recruited consecutively from 2005 to 2011. From these 503 
participants, we excluded 51 participants with missing data on 
one of the neurological variables used to define DSPN, two 
participants with diabetes forms other than type 1 or type 2 
diabetes and 36 participants with missing covariates, leaving 
423 participants with complete data for analysis (ESM Fig. 1). 

Measurement of serum NFL NFL was measured in serum of 
fasting participants at baseline using the Olink Target 96 
Neuro Exploratory multiplex assay panel (Olink Proteomics, 
Uppsala, Sweden; NFL Uniprot ID: P07196 and NFL Olink 
ID: OID05206) based on proximity extension assay technology. 
The relative concentration of serum NFL is expressed as 
normalised protein expression (NPX) values, which are 
comparable in their distribution to log2-transformed protein 
concentrations. A detailed description of all 92 biomarkers 
in the panel is given in ESM Table 1; data cleaning steps that 
left 60 biomarkers, in addition to NFL, for exploratory 
analysis are described in ESM Fig. 2. We first excluded 29 
biomarkers because of missing data for =25%. Then, we 
further excluded two biomarkers because of inter-assay CV 
>25%. 

Assessment of peripheral neuropathy All participants underwent 
nerve conduction studies (NCSs) and quantitative sensory 
testing (QST) as previously described [33, 34]. Motor nerve 
conduction velocity (MNCV) was measured in the peroneal, 
median and ulnar nerves, while sensory nerve conduction 


velocity (SNCV) and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) 
were measured in the sural, median and ulnar nerves. All 
nerve stimulations were performed using surface electrodes 
(Nicolet VikingQuest; Natus Medical, San Carlos, CA, 
USA) after warming up feet and lower legs to ensure that skin 
temperature was 33–34°C. QST was evaluated by thermal 
detection thresholds (TDTs) to warm and cold stimuli at the 
thenar eminence and dorsum of the foot using the method of 
limits (TSA-II NeuroSensory Analyzer; Medoc, Ramat 
Yishai, Israel). Neurological examination was performed 
using the Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS) for neuropathic 
signs and the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) for neuropathic 
symptoms [35]. Stages of DSPN were defined, according 
to the Toronto Consensus criteria [36], as subclinical, 
confirmed asymptomatic and confirmed symptomatic as 
previously described [33]. 

Covariates Body weight (kg), waist circumference (cm) and 
height (m) were measured at enrolment. Information on 
known diabetes duration (days), presence of chronic diseases, 
use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (yes/ 
no) and lipid-lowering drugs (yes/no) was obtained during a 
face-to-face interview. Hypertension was defined as either 
systolic BP =140 mmHg, diastolic BP =90 mmHg or use of 
antihypertensive medication. Self-reported myocardial infarction, 
peripheral arterial occlusive disease, cerebrovascular 
disease or stroke was used to define the presence of CVD. 
Total cholesterol and HbA1c were measured according to 
standardised laboratory procedures in blood samples collected 
at baseline after overnight fasting [31]. Diabetes-related autoantibodies 
were measured for each participant. The eGFR was 
calculated from serum creatinine and cystatin C using the 
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology (CKD-EPI) equation 
[37]. 

Statistical analyses Data are presented as median (25th, 75th 
percentiles), mean ± SD, or percentages in descriptive statistics. 
Differences in characteristics according to DSPN status 
were tested with generalised linear regression analyses 
allowing for different group variances using the SAS procedure 
GLIMMIX and with the .2 test, while differences in 
serum NFL levels between the two groups were tested with 
ANCOVA to allow adjustment for age at diagnosis. In addition, 
differences in means and 95% CIs were also calculated. 
Spearman’s rank correlation tests estimated the non-adjusted 
and age-adjusted correlations of serum NFL with demographic 
and metabolic variables. 

In primary analyses, we assessed the associations of serum 
NFL with DSPN (primary endpoint) and with nerve function 
measures (exploratory secondary endpoints). First, the association 
of serum NFL (independent variable, by 1-NPX 

increase, by 1-SD increase and by tertiles) with DSPN (binary 
dependent variable) was assessed using Poisson regression 
models with a robust error variance. Model 1 was adjusted 
for sex and age at diagnosis. Model 2 was additionally adjusted 
for waist circumference, height, HbA1c, known diabetes 
duration, diabetes type, eGFR, total cholesterol, hypertension, 
CVD, lipid-lowering drugs and NSAIDs. Based on our previous 
studies, these covariates were defined a priori as covariates 
that may affect nerve conduction [38, 39]. Associations 
were estimated with RRs of DSPN and their corresponding 
95% CIs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves 
were used to assess the predictive performance of serum 
NFL. We conducted the following sensitivity analyses to test 
the robustness of our results: (1) we substituted waist circumference 
and height with BMI; (2) we excluded individuals 
with type 1 diabetes; and (3) we excluded participants with 
prevalent self-reported CVD (n=10). In addition, we tested 
for interaction with diabetes type. Second, the associations 
of serum NFL with MNCVs and SNCVs were assessed 
using multivariable linear regression models, while associations 
with SNAPs and TDTs were assessed using quantile 
regression models, which do not make assumptions about 
the residual distribution. These analyses were adjusted for 
the same covariates as in the Poisson regression models, 
and associations were estimated with ß estimates and their 
corresponding 95% CIs. In addition, for each participant, 
individual MNCVs, SNCVs and SNAPs were standardised 
and summarised in sum scores, which were used as additional 
secondary outcomes analysed using multivariable 
linear regression models. Z scores were calculated by 
subtracting the mean value of nerve conduction velocity 
(NCV) in the study population from the value in the individual 
and dividing the result by the SD. We constructed an 
‘MNCV sum score’ basedonMNCVs, an ‘SNCV sum 
score’ basedonSNCVs, anda ‘total NCV sum score’ based 
on MNCVs, SNCVs and SNAPs. The sum scores combine 
information about the NCVs of different nerves by giving 
equal weight to each nerve, allowing for a more comprehensive 
assessment of nerve function in an individual [39, 
40]. Primary analyses addressing a pre-planned hypothesis 
on NFL with primary and secondary exploratory endpoints 
were not adjusted for multiple testing. 

In a secondary hypothesis-free exploratory analysis, all 
analyses mentioned above for NFL were performed for the 
remaining 60 biomarkers of the Olink Target 96 Neuro 
Exploratory multiplex assay. These hypothesis-free analyses 
were adjusted for multiple testing with the Bonferroni method 
(a recommended approach when many tests are carried out 
without pre-planned hypotheses) [41] and a Bonferronicorrected 
p<0.0008 (0.05/61) indicated significant 
associations. 

All statistical analyses were carried out with SAS version 

9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), and p values <0.05 were 


considered indicators of a statistically significant correlation, 
difference or association unless otherwise stated. The visualisation 
was carried out with RStudio version 4.0.5 (https:// 
posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop). 

Results 

Participants’ characteristics Participants with different 
DSPN severity stages (subclinical [n=41], confirmed 
asymptomatic [n=11] and confirmed symptomatic [n=14]) 
were merged to create an overall DSPN group (n=66, 16%), 
which was compared with participants without DSPN 
(n=357, 84%). 

Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics 
of the study population overall (n=423) and stratified by 
DSPN status. Participants with DSPN were more likely to be 

men, to be older, and to have higher waist circumference and 
height than individuals without DSPN. They were also more 
likely to have type 2 diabetes, a shorter known diabetes duration 
and use lipid-lowering drugs. However, there was no 
evidence for differences in HbA1c, cholesterol levels or 
proportion of individuals with hypertension, CVD and use 
of NSAIDs between those with and without DSPN. Serum 
NFL levels (median [25th percentile, 75th percentile]) were 
higher in participants with DSPN (4.0 [3.6, 4.5]) compared 
with those without DSPN (3.7 [3.2, 4.0], p<0.0001) 
(Table 1 and Fig. 1), and higher in each DSPN stage 
compared with the group without DSPN despite the small 
sample size (ESM Fig. 3). 

Serum NFL levels were positively correlated with age at 
diagnosis (r=0.61, p<0.0001) (ESM Fig. 4) but correlations with 
BMI, waist circumference, height, HbA1c, total cholesterol and 
eGFR varied before and after adjustment for age (ESM Table 2).

(Q1) quartiles. The extreme line shows Q3+1.5×IQR to Q1-1.5×IQR. 
Serum NFL is expressed as NPX values 

Association of serum NFL with DSPN Table 2 shows the association 
between serum NFL and prevalent DSPN. In model 
1, adjusted for sex and age at diagnosis, higher serum NFL 
levels were positively associated with prevalent DSPN (RR 
[95% CI] per 1-NPX increase, 1.94 [1.51, 2.49]; p<0.0001). 
This positive association remained constant in model 2 (the 
fully adjusted model) (RR [95% CI] 1.92 [1.50, 2.45]; 
p<0.0001). Similarly, participants in the second and third 
tertiles of serum NFL showed higher adjusted RRs for prevalent 
DSPN compared with those in the lowest tertile (RR 
[95% CI] 2.63 [1.31, 5.29] for tertile 2 and 4.28 [1.50, 

12.17] for tertile 3; ptrend=0.007). ESM Fig. 5 shows that 
the AUC of serum NFL for DSPN as outcome was 0.66 
(95% CI 0.59, 0.74; p<0.0001). 
Sensitivity analyses The association of serum NFL levels with 
prevalent DSPN remained consistent when waist circumference 
and height were substituted with BMI (RR [95% CI] per 
1-NPX increase 1.88 [1.47, 2.40]) and when the analyses were 
restricted to participants with type 2 diabetes (RR [95% CI] 

1.96 [1.51, 2.54]). These associations remained robust when 
the analysis was repeated after excluding participants with 
prevalent CVD (RR [95% CI] 1.87 [1.46, 2.39]). Interaction 
by diabetes type was not significant (p=0.99). 
Associations of serum NFL with peripheral nerve function 
tests Table 3 displays the associations of serum NFL with 
nerve conduction measures. Higher serum NFL levels were 
associated with slower MNCV (all p<0.0001) and SNCV (all 
p=0.03) in all nerves and lower NCV sum scores (all 
p<0.0001). These associations were observed in model 1 
and remained consistent in model 2. The highest estimates 
were found for peroneal MNCV and sural SNCV. In addition, 
higher serum NFL levels were associated with lower sural 
SNAP (p=0.0004) only in model 2. Table 4 displays the associations 
of serum NFL with TDT. Higher serum NFL levels 
were only associated with higher TDT to warm stimuli on the 
hand and foot in model 2 (p=0.023 and p=0.004 for hand and 
foot, respectively). 

Exploratory analyses ESM Fig. 6 shows that correlations 
between biomarkers were almost all positive (r values ranged 
between 0.1 and 0.5) and ESM Fig. 7 shows that correlations 
between most biomarkers and age, BMI, waist circumference 
and total cholesterol were predominantly positive. In contrast, 
correlations between biomarkers and eGFR were mainly 
negative. Most biomarkers, except cadherin (CDH)-15, 
secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) and signal recognition 
particle 14 kDa protein (SRP14), did not show differences 
in their expression levels when comparing individuals 
with and without DSPN (p>0.05) (ESM Table 3). 

Associations of biomarkers with prevalent DSPN are 
reported in ESM Table 4. Only serum SFRP1 was positively 
associated with prevalent DSPN in model 1 and model 2 but 
this association did not remain significant after adjustment for 
multiple testing. ß estimates for the associations of biomarkers 
with MNCVs, SNCVs and NCV sum scores are shown in 
ESM Fig. 8 (ß estimates by 1-NPX increase) and in ESM 
Fig. 9 (ß estimates by 1-SD increase). Most associations were

inverse. After full adjustment for covariates, eight biomarkers 
were associated with MNCV in at least one motor nerve and 
six biomarkers were associated with SNCV in at least one 
sensory nerve (p<0.05). In particular, CDH17 and disintegrin 
and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 15 
(ADAM15) showed inverse associations with the three sensory 
nerves investigated. Proline-rich Akt 1 substrate 1 
(AKT1S1) was the only biomarker inversely associated with 
MNCV and SNCV. However, these associations were 
abolished when multiple testing was taken into account.

Discussion 

The results of this cross-sectional study in individuals recently 
diagnosed with type 1 and type 2 diabetes from the GDS 
baseline cohort demonstrated associations between higher 
serum NFL levels and prevalent DSPN. In addition, we 
showed the association of higher serum NFL levels with large 
myelinated fibre dysfunction, evident by slower MNCV and 
SNCV as well as a lower SNAP. Moreover, higher serum 
NFL levels were associated with elevated TDTs to warm

a Model 1: adjusted for sex and age at diagnosis 
b Model 2: additionally adjusted for waist circumference, height, HbA1c, known diabetes duration, diabetes type, eGFR, total cholesterol, hypertension, 
CVD, use of lipid-lowering drugs and NSAIDs 

rather than cold stimuli, indicating that small unmyelinated C-
fibres, rather than thinly myelinated Ad-fibres, contributed to 
this relationship. These associations were independent of age 
and other covariables, robust to sensitivity analyses, and 
aligned with our hypothesis that serum NFL is a promising 
biomarker to indicate early peripheral nerve dysfunction due 
to DSPN. However, this study did not reveal any associations 
between other neurological biomarkers and DSPN in exploratory 
analyses. 

Our study is the first to show that high serum NFL levels 
are associated with an almost fourfold higher prevalence of 
DSPN. We measured serum NFL with a sensitive method 
and defined DSPN using the Toronto Consensus criteria. 
Additionally, we adjusted the associations for relevant 
confounders. When analysing NCS data separately, associations 
were more pronounced in the peroneal motor and sural 
sensory nerves than in the median and ulnar motor and sensory 
nerves. This pattern indicates a relatively higher degree of 
myelin damage and more intense axonal damage in lower limb 
nerves than in upper limb nerves. Such a finding is plausible 
for the following reasons: (1) the longer lower limb axons are 
more vulnerable to injury than upper limb axons [4]; (2) 
substantial evidence suggests that the earliest nerve damage 
occurs in the sural nerve early after diabetes diagnosis [42]; 
and (3) electrophysiological measures acquired in the sural 
sensory and peroneal motor nerves are considered the most 
sensitive NCS by which to detect early large fibre dysfunction 
in diabetes [43] and represent the first-line tests by the 
American Academy of Neurology [44]. 

Our findings considerably extend those of a previous 
epidemiological study reporting inverse correlations between 
serum NFL and NCV in the peroneal motor but not the sural 
sensory nerve in individuals with type 2 diabetes [29]. 
However, that study reported only Spearman’s correlations 
and did not estimate the associations between serum NFL 
and NCVs in multivariable models, possibly introducing bias 
due to confounding. In contrast, our study adjusted for multiple 
confounders. In addition, the previous study’s participants 
included only individuals with type 2 diabetes who were relatively 
older (age 35–85 years) and had a longer known diabetes 
duration (up to 3 years) compared with our study, which 
included participants with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes, 
who were relatively younger (median age 47.7 years) and had 
a median known diabetes duration of 6 months. Therefore, our 
study provides the first comprehensive analysis of the associations 
between serum NFL and nerve function in individuals 
recently diagnosed with diabetes. 

Notably, the observed associations between serum NFL 
and sural sensory nerve function are consistent with sural 
nerve biopsies indicating a positive correlation between higher 
serum NFL levels and axonal loss in older individuals with 
peripheral neuropathy of different aetiologies (6% diabetic) 
[45]. Thus, both electrophysiological and pathological 

findings reinforce the utility of serum NFL in quantifying 
axonal degeneration. 

Though NFL is known as a biomarker of axonal loss, we 
detected more robust associations with NCV (typically 
regarded as an indicator of myelin damage) than with SNAP 
(typically regarded as an indicator of axonal loss). Evidence 
indicates that demyelination can exist in people with diabetes 
with and without symptomatic DSPN, but the axonal loss is 
linked to the appearance of symptoms [46]. Since only 14 out 
of 66 individuals with DSPN in our sample were symptomatic, 
this low prevalence of symptomatic DSPN might explain 
our study’s less pronounced associations between NFL and 
SNAP compared with the more pronounced associations with 
NCV. Nevertheless, the observed associations of NFL with 
both NCV and SNAP, though to a different extent, could 
suggest that NFL can be considered a biomarker of overall 
nerve injury (axonal loss and demyelination) rather than solely 
axonal loss. Others have shown increased NFL levels in individuals 
with polyneuropathies of different aetiologies irrespective 
of the associated pattern (demyelinating, axonal or 
both) [22], strengthening the suggestion that increased 
systemic NFL levels may be an indicator of either axonal 
damage, demyelination or both. 

Associations between serum NFL and nerve conduction 
were more robust and consistent than associations between 
NFL and sensory nerve function, although large nerve fibres 
represent only a tiny fraction of nerve fibres. This difference is 
likely due to the abundant expression of NFL in large fibres 
where it is needed to increase the axonal diameter and speed 
up nerve conduction [10], unlike small sensory nerves with 
minimal nerve conduction that do not express high NFL 
levels. Another reason for this difference is that NCSs represent 
a more objective and robust instrument to estimate DSPN 
than QST [47]. Consequently, NCS-driven measures of nerve 
function in large nerves might be more relevant in this context 
than QST-driven measures in small nerves. In contrast to our 
study, which found associations of serum NFL with TDT to 
warm but not cold stimuli, a previous study measuring serum 
NFL with the Simoa Technology showed correlations with 
both warm and cold stimuli [29], although that study reported 
only non-adjusted correlations. 

This present study demonstrated higher age-independent 
serum NFL levels in individuals with DSPN than in those 
without DSPN shortly after a diabetes diagnosis. A previous 
study in individuals with known diabetes duration of less than 
3 years did not find a difference in serum NFL levels between 
individuals with and without DSPN [29]. However, the same 
study found a difference in serum NFL levels between individuals 
with DSPN and healthy control individuals. In another 
study, circulatory NFL mRNA was higher in individuals with 
DSPN than in those without DSPN [30]. It is worth noting that 
elevated serum NFL levels have been reported in peripheral 
neuropathies other than DSPN [13, 15, 17, 22, 25]. 

Substantial evidence associates higher serum NFL levels 
with various neurodegenerative diseases of the peripheral and 
central nervous systems [12]. Therefore, serum NFL is not a 
DSPN-specific biomarker and cannot be used as a biomarker 
for the diagnosis of DSPN. However, if the association between 
serum NFL and DSPN reported in our study is validated in 
other studies, future research should investigate the clinical 
utility of serum NFL as a biomarker for DSPN monitoring, 
given that a periodic serum NFL measurement is non-
invasive and can be accessible in daily clinical care. 
Additionally, future studies might then investigate the potential 
of serum NFL as a candidate surrogate endpoint in phase II 
trials evaluating new therapies for DSPN, given that 
laboratory-measured biomarkers are objective, reproducible 
and not subject to inter-observer variability. 

Exploratory analysis revealed inverse associations between 
some neurological biomarkers (e.g. ADAM15, involved in 
wound healing) and NCVs; these associations were abolished 
after adjustment for multiple testing, likely because Bonferroni 
correction is a conservative approach. It is also plausible that 
biomarkers reflecting nerve repair processes and axon development 
have a limited role in recent-onset diabetes. Thus, future 
studies, including participants with more prolonged diabetes, 
may reveal more biomarkers associated with nerve injury. 

This study has several strengths. First, we included relatively 
young individuals with a median known diabetes duration of 6 
months and good overall health status. This selection allowed 
analyses of associations without the confounding effect of late 
diabetes-related and ageing-related comorbidities. Second, 
neurophysiological testing targeted both large and small fibre 
functions. Third, our statistical analysis was comprehensively 
adjusted for covariates and associations were assessed for 
different outcomes modelled as a binary variable, continuous 
nerve function in single nerves and sum scores. Our study 
includes the following limitations: (1) the cross-sectional 
design precludes us from knowing the predictive value of 
serum NFL; (2) the inclusion of individuals with wellcontrolled 
diabetes for whom the extent of nerve damage is 
lower than individuals with less-controlled diabetes; (3) the 
predominance of subclinical DSPN prevents us from assessing 
the associations between serum NFL and DSPN stages; and (4) 
the lack of statistical power to stratify the analyses by diabetes 
type. However, as the interaction between serum NFL and 
diabetes type was not significant, there was no evidence for a 
difference in the observed associations between type 1 and type 
2 diabetes. In addition, biomarkers were measured with the 
highly sensitive proximity extension assay technology. 
Though protein levels were expressed as NPX values rather 
than absolute concentrations, this aspect did not impact our 
findings. Finally, our study population consists of mainly 
German individuals with short known diabetes duration. 
Thus, our findings cannot be generalisable to other ethnicities 
and individuals with longer diabetes duration. 

Conclusion Our study indicates that higher serum NFL levels are 
associated with prevalent DSPN and nerve dysfunction in recently 
diagnosed diabetes. We advocate serum NFL as a novel 
blood-based biomarker of nerve injury in DSPN. However, the 
potential clinical utility of serum NFL as a monitoring biomarker 
for DSPN in routine clinical practice and as a biomarker in clinical 
trials needs to be investigated in future studies.
