OBJECTIVES: Patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) have a high risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) which 
is associated with an increased risk of death and persistent renal failure. 
Early prediction of AKI is crucial in order to implement preventive strategies. 
The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive performance of 
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 and insulin like growth factor binding 
protein 7 (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) in critically ill patients with 
COVID-19-associated ARDS.
DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, observational study.
SETTING: Twelve centers across Europe and United Kingdom.
PATIENTS: Patients with moderate or severe COVID-19-associated ARDS were 
included and serial measurements of (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) were performed.
INTERVENTIONS: None.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary endpoint was the development of 
moderate or severe AKI according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global 
Outcomes definition. Three hundred patients were available for the primary 
analysis, and 39 met the primary endpoint. At enrollment, urinary (TIMP-2) × 
(IGFBP7) had high predictive value for the primary endpoint with an area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.93). 
(TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) was significantly higher in endpoint-positive patients at 
enrollment and at 12 hours.
CONCLUSIONS: Urinary (TIMP-2) × (IGFBP7) predicts the occurrence of AKI in 
critically ill patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.
