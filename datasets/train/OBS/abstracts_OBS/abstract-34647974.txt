OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations between signal sensitivity, central 
auditory processing, and dementia and Alzheimer dementia (AD) risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This follow-up observational study of a 
sample from the prospective Adult Changes in Thought study of dementia risk was 
conducted at Kaiser Permanente Washington, a western Washington health care 
delivery system, and included 280 volunteer participants without dementia who 
were evaluated from October 2003 to February 2006 with follow-up through 
September 2018. Analyses began in 2019 and continued through 2021.
EXPOSURES: Hearing tests included pure tone signal audibility, a monaural word 
recognition test, and 2 dichotic tests: the Dichotic Sentence Identification 
(DSI) test and the Dichotic Digits test (DDT).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cognition was assessed biennially with the Cognitive 
Abilities Screening Instrument (range, 1-100; higher scores are better), and 
scores of less than 86 prompted clinical and neuropsychological evaluations. All 
data were reviewed at multidisciplinary consensus conferences, and standardized 
criteria were used to define incident cases of dementia and probable or possible 
AD. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine associations with 
hearing test performance.
RESULTS: A total of 280 participants (177 women [63%]; mean [SD] age, 79.5 [5.2] 
years). As of September 2018, there were 2196 person-years of follow-up (mean, 
7.8 years) and 89 incident cases of dementia (66 not previously analyzed), of 
which 84 (94.4%) were AD (63 not previously analyzed). Compared with people with 
DSI scores of more than 80, the dementia adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for DSI 
scores of less than 50 was 4.18 (95% CI, 2.37-7.38; P < .001); for a DSI score 
of 50 to 80, it was 1.82 (95% CI, 1.10-3.04; P = .02). Compared with people with 
DDT scores of more than 80, the dementia aHR for DDT scores of less than 50 was 
2.66 (95% CI, 1.31-5.42; P = .01); for a DDT score of 50 to 80, it was 2.40 (95% 
CI, 1.45-3.98; P = .001). The AD results were similar. Pure tone averages were 
weakly and insignificantly associated with dementia and AD, and associations 
were null when controlling for DSI scores.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, abnormal central auditory 
processing as measured by dichotic tests was independently associated with 
dementia and AD risk.
