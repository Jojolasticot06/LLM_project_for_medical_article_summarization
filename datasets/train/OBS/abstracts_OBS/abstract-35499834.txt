OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a moderate-intensity exercise intervention can 
affect the rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate per cystatin C 
(eGFRCysC) change in older adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This ancillary analysis of the Lifestyle 
Interventions and Independence For Elders randomized clinical trial enrolled 
1199 community-dwelling, sedentary adults aged 70 to 89 years with mobility 
limitations and available blood specimens. The original trial was conducted 
across 8 academic centers in the US from February 2010 through December 2013. 
Data for this study were analyzed from March 29, 2021, to February 28, 2022.
INTERVENTIONS: Structured, 2-year, partially supervised, moderate-intensity 
physical activity and exercise (strength, flexibility) intervention compared 
with a health education control intervention with 2-year follow-up. Physical 
activity was measured by step count and minutes of moderate-intensity activity 
using accelerometers.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was change in eGFRCysC. Rapid 
eGFRCysC decline was defined by the high tertile threshold of 6.7%/y.
RESULTS: Among the 1199 participants in the analysis, the mean (SD) age was 78.9 
(5.2) years, and 800 (66.7%) were women. At baseline, the 2 groups were well 
balanced by age, comorbidity, and baseline eGFRCysC. The physical activity and 
exercise intervention resulted in statistically significantly lower decline in 
eGFRCysC over 2 years compared with the health education arm (mean difference, 
0.96 mL/min/1.73 m2; 95% CI, 0.02-1.91 mL/min/1.73 m2) and lower odds of rapid 
eGFRCysC decline (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.97).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this ancillary analysis of a randomized 
clinical trial showed that when compared with health education, a physical 
activity and exercise intervention slowed the rate of decline in eGFRCysC among 
community-dwelling sedentary older adults. Clinicians should consider targeted 
recommendation of physical activity and moderate-intensity exercise for older 
adults as a treatment to slow decline in eGFRCysC.
