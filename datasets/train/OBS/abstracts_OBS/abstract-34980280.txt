BACKGROUND: Previous evidence indicates associations between the female 
reproductive tract microbiome composition and reproductive outcome in infertile 
patients undergoing assisted reproduction. We aimed to determine whether the 
endometrial microbiota composition is associated with reproductive outcomes of 
live birth, biochemical pregnancy, clinical miscarriage or no pregnancy.
METHODS: Here, we present a multicentre prospective observational study using 
16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyse endometrial fluid and biopsy samples before 
embryo transfer in a cohort of 342 infertile patients asymptomatic for infection 
undergoing assisted reproductive treatments.
RESULTS: A dysbiotic endometrial microbiota profile composed of Atopobium, 
Bifidobacterium, Chryseobacterium, Gardnerella, Haemophilus, Klebsiella, 
Neisseria, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus was associated with unsuccessful 
outcomes. In contrast, Lactobacillus was consistently enriched in patients with 
live birth outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that endometrial microbiota composition 
before embryo transfer is a useful biomarker to predict reproductive outcome, 
offering an opportunity to further improve diagnosis and treatment strategies.
