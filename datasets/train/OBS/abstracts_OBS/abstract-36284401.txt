Gastrostomy fed children traditionally have a Formulae diet (FD), which fulfills 
nutritional requirements; however, many families are adopting Blended diets 
(BD), which are what the whole family would eat. We undertook an observational 
investigation of the colonic microbiota and metabonome in a small group of 
gastrostomy fed children, who were either on an FD or BD, and compared, where 
possible to their siblings (17 FD, 28 BD, 19 HS). There was no increase in 
complications in tube blockage or infection rates, but a significant improvement 
in the prevalence of bowel problems, a reduction in medication and an increase 
in quality of life. Metataxonomic analysis showed that the FD group was 
significantly different to the Sibling group, and that families did not cluster 
together. Whole sample metabonomics showed no differences between groups; 
however, univariate analysis of biologically important metabolites did differ. 
Changing to a BD resulted in no increase in complications or risks, but improved 
the overall quality of life for the children and families.
