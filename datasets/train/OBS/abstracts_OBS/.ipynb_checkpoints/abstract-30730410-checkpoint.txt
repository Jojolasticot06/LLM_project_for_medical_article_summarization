1/PURPOSE: To improve the potential for finding clinically important subtypes of  patients with lower urinary tract symptoms we developed the CASUS (Comprehensive  Assessment of Self-reported Urinary Symptoms). We used it to present data on the  experiences of lower urinary tract symptoms in treatment seeking women and men  from a prospective observational cohort. 
2/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created an initial list of lower urinary tract  symptoms that were confirmed in 22 qualitative interviews with providers, and 88  qualitative interviews with care seeking and noncare seeking women and men with  lower urinary tract symptoms. Items from extant measures were adopted and  revised, and new items were developed. All items were evaluated for  understanding in 64 cognitive interviews. Items were administered to a  prospective cohort of female and male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms  who were seeking care. Analyses were done to describe item response  distributions and correlations among item responses separately for women and  men. 
3/RESULTS: A total of 444 males and 372 females provided responses to the CASUS.  Several sets of items showed different relationships for women compared to men.  In particular the associations between sensation related items and incontinence  related items were generally positive among females but often negative among  males.
4/CONCLUSIONS: After using an intensive development process the CASUS addresses a  wide range of lower urinary tract symptoms. It should help identify clinically  important subtypes of patients. Further, item collection can provide the  foundation for shorter measures for use in the clinic and as trial end points.
