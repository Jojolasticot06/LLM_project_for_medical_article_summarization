1/BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that severity of the immune response induced by immune cells is associated with morbidity and mortality from acute pancreatitis. The authors investigated and evaluated the relationship between distinct peripheral lymphocyte subsets at admission and clinical outcome prior to hospital discharge so as to find a predictor to the prognosis of acute pancreatitis in lymphocyte profile. 
2/METHODS: Lymphocyte subsets in admission peripheral venous blood were tested through flow cytometry on 48 patients with acute pancreatitis. Clinical data was recorded as well. The primary observational outcomes were multiple organ failure (MOF) and infection. 
3/RESULTS: There was a significant difference in natural killer cells between two subgroups sorted by the presence or absence of infection (25.5 ± 4.47 [95% CI 14.4, 36.6] vs 14.8 ± 7.62 [95% CI 12.5,1 7.1] p = 0.021). Patients who developed MOF had lower CD4 + CD25 + CD127high (4.49 ± 1.5 (MOF) [95% CI 3.83, 5.16] vs 6.57 ± 2.65 (non-MOF) [95% CI 5.5, 7.64] p = 0.002) and higher CD127low/high cell counts (1.35 ± 0.66 [95% CI 1.06, 1.65] vs 0.97 ± 0.44 [95% CI 0.79, 1.15] p = 0.02). MOF patients were significantly older (55 ± 14.58 [95% CI 48.49,61.42] vs 46 ± 15.59 [95% CI 39.39,51.99] p = 0.04), and had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation IIscores (7 ± 3.66 [95% CI 5.5,7.64] vs 4 ± 2.89 [95% CI 2.45,4.78] p = 0.001) and C reactive protein (100.53 ± 94.38 [95% CI 58.69,142.48] vs 50.8 ± 59.2 [95% CI 26.88,74.71] p = 0.04). In a multivariate regression model, only CD4 + CD25 + CD127high cell was a significant predictor of non-MOF. For the detection of non-MOF, CD4 + CD25 + CD127high cell generated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with an area under the curve of 0.74. 
4/CONCLUSION: CD4 + CD25 + CD127high cell at early phase of acute pancreatitis yields good specificity in detecting non-MOF at a suggested cutoff value 6.41%. Patients with fewer natural killer cells may be at risk in developing secondary infection.
