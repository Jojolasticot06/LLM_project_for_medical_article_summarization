OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether circulating micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) 
predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and inform decision-making in 
breast cancer patients.
INTRODUCTION: Deciphering response to NAC remains a challenge. Those unlikely to 
respond may benefit from NAC de-escalation before completion, while "responders" 
should complete treatment. Establishing biomarkers which identify response to 
NAC is imperative to personalize treatment strategies. miRNAs are small 
noncoding RNA molecules which modulate genetic expression. miRNAs are believed 
to inform response to NAC.
METHODS: This prospective, multicenter trial (NCT01722851) recruited 120 
patients treated with NAC across 8 Irish treatment sites. Predetermined miRNAs 
were quantified from patient whole bloods using relative quantification 
polymerase chain reactiond. Venous sampling was performed at diagnosis and 
midway during NAC. Trends in miRNA expression between timepoints were correlated 
with treatment response. Data analysis was performed using R 3.2.3.
RESULTS: A total of 120 patients were included (median age: 55 years). Overall, 
49.2% had luminal breast cancers (59/120), 17.5% luminal B (L/HER2) (21/120), 
12.5% human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 positive (HER2+) (15/120), and 
20.8% triple negative disease (25/120). In total, 46.7% of patients responded to 
NAC (56/125) and 26.7% achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) (32/120). 
For patients with L/HER2, increased Let-7a predicted response to NAC ( P 
=0.049), while decreased miR-145 predicted response to NAC in HER2+ ( P =0.033). 
For patients with luminal breast cancers, reduced Let-7a predicted achieving a 
pCR ( P =0.037) and reduced miR-145 predicted achieving a pCR to NAC in HER2+ ( 
P =0.027).
CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the potential value of circulatory miRNA 
measurement in predicting response to NAC. Further interrogation of these 
findings may see miRNAs personalize therapeutic decision-making for patients 
undergoing NAC for early breast cancer.
