Introduction

The dose–response relationship between long-term intensive endurance 
exercise and coronary heart disease has intrigued investigators 
for decades. Early studies indicated that regular endurance sport participation 
provides relative immunity from ischaemic heart disease.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Yet, more recent studies reported an increased prevalence of coronary 
atherosclerotic plaques amongst highly trained athletes in comparison 
to healthy non-athletes.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
These findings spurred debate about a 
potential selection bias in these series, age-related differences and 
prior presence of cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Furthermore, these studies emphasized a relative difference in plaque 
composition with a higher likelihood of more stable calcified plaques 
in athletes as compared to non-athletes in whom plaque type was 


most frequently mixed. However, data on the absolute prevalence of 
calcified and non-calcified coronary plaques in athletes as compared 
to non-athletes are lacking. Hence, it is possible that endurance athletes 
may have a similar or even greater amount of non-calcified and mixed 
plaques just because the overall number of plaques is higher.

A better understanding of the upper range of the dose–response relationship 
between exercise and coronary artery disease is desirable given 
the popularity of intensive endurance sports in modern society. 
Regular exercise improves blood pressure control and lipid profiles, reduces 
the incidence of diabetes and myocardial infarction, and increases 
life expectancy.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/
Increased cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with 
a progressive reduction of cardiovascular events, which would seem to 
be at odds with the aforementioned link between lifelong exercise load 
and increased coronary atherosclerosis.

The Master@Heart study aimed to investigate the apparent paradox 
of increased coronary atherosclerosis amongst highly trained endurance 
athletes despite having fewer cardiovascular events. We hypothesized 
that lifelong endurance exercise, and to a lesser degree late-onset 
training, would be associated with a lower prevalence of non-calcified 
and mixed plaques as compared to an active, healthy lifestyle without 
regular endurance training.

Methods

The rationale, design, and methodology of the Master@Heart study have 
been described previously and can be summarized as follows.https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/


Study design

The Master@Heart (Master Athlete’s Heart) study was a multicentre 
(University Hospitals Leuven, University Hospital Antwerp, and Jessa 
Hospital Hasselt) prospective cohort study, funded by the Fund for 
Scientific Research, Flanders (T003717N). ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier 
NCT03711539. The primary endpoint of the current manuscript was investigated 
in a cross-sectional design.

Study population

A dedicated web portal (http://www.masteratheart.be
) informed potential study 
participants about the study and provided an online screening questionnaire 
to assess the eligibility of study candidates. The web portal was advertised 
to the wide community through media advertisements (e.g. traditional 
broadcasting, social media, and popular athletic magazines). The inclusion 
criteria for all participants were male sex and age between 45 and 70 years. 
Athletes were defined as follows: questionnaire reported engagement in 
cycling =8 h or running = 6 h per week, or triathlon (combination of swimming, 
cycling, and running) = 8 h per week for at least 6 months prior to 
baseline. Lifelong and late-onset athletes started regular endurance exercise 
training at <30 years and >30 years of age, respectively. Non-athletes engaged 
= 3 h per week in physical activity without prior exposure to regular 
endurance exercise. The metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per 
week was calculated as a measure of exercise volumes obtained by multiplying 
the MET score for the specific sport by the reported exercise volume 
(minutes/week).http://www.masteratheart.be


Exclusion criteria were a medical history of cardiovascular disease, history 
of established risk factors for coronary artery disease (diabetes mellitus, 
hypercholesterolaemia, or arterial hypertension), current or past 
history of smoking, a body mass index >27.2 kg/m², and a known allergy 
to iodine contrast agents.

From all eligible subjects, 605 were sampled at random for inclusion to 
minimize the risk of selection bias. Sampling was however stratified by current 
age (45–53, 54–62, and 63–70 years). As the prevalence of high-level 
endurance athletes decreases with age, a participant distribution of 3/7 
aged 45–53 years, 3/7 aged 54–62 years, and 1/7 aged 63–70 years was 
applied.

In addition, sampling was stratified by the age at which endurance training 
was started. Lifelong athletes were subdivided into <20 and 20–30 years of 
age at which endurance training was started. Late-onset athletes were subdivided 
into 31–40 and >40 years.

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry

A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (Discovery W, Hologic, Bedford, 
Massachusetts, USA – GE Lunar Prodigy Advance GE Healthcare, Horton 
Norway) was performed to measure body fat percentage.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing

As a measure of aerobic capacity, peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was determined 
using a continuous bicycle stress test. The respiratory gas exchange 
was analysed using a breath-by-breath open-circuit spirometry 
system. Peak oxygen uptake was be determined as the highest 30 s of oxygen 
uptake.

Computed tomography coronary angiography

Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) was acquired using 
a 128-slice dual-source CT scanner (Siemens Somatom Force - Siemens 
Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany), a 256-slice CT scanner (GE 
Revolution - GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin), or a 320-slice CT scanner 
(Aquilion ONE ViSION - Canon Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan). We 
administered esmolol intravenously when necessary to achieve target heart 
rates of <65 bpm. All subjects received 0.4 mg sublingual nitroglycerine 
2 min before scanning. First, a non-enhanced ECG-synchronized scan was 
taken to quantify coronary calcium rendering the Agatston coronary artery 
calcium (CAC) score. Secondly, an ECG-triggered CTCA was acquired 
after the intravenous injection of iodinated contrast medium in an antecubital 
vein followed by a saline chaser.

All coronary atherosclerotic lesions were analysed using Syngo.Via (Siemens 
Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) or GE Advanced Workstation (GE 
Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) software. Computed tomography coronary 
angiography interpreters were blinded to the athletic background of the 
study participants and to the other study examinations. All coronary lesions 
were interpreted following the 2016 SCCT guidelines for their location, stenosis 
grade, composition (calcified, mixed, and non-calcified) as well as their vulnerability 
(positive remodeling, low-attenuation plaque, spotty calcification, 
and the napkin-ring sign).http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
A density of >130 HU defined calcified areas. 
Calcified plaques were entirely composed of calcified areas. Mixed plaques 
were composed of both calcified and non-calcified areas. Non-calcified plaques 
were entirely composed of non-calcified areas. A proximal plaque was 
defined as a plaque in coronary segments 1 (right coronary artery), 5 (left 
main), 6 (left anterior descending), and 11 (circumflex). In addition, we calculated 
the segment stenosis score (SSS) and segment-involvement score (SIS) 
to assess the overall plaque burden. The SSS was calculated as the sum of 
the luminal stenosis score (0–3; 0%, < 50%, 50%–70%, > 70%) of each of 
the 15 coronary segments (minimum 0; maximum 45). The SIS was calculated 
as the sum of coronary segments with plaques irrespective of the degree of 
luminal stenosis (minimum = 0; maximum = 15).http://www.masteratheart.be
The SSS and SIS have demonstrated 
clinical validity in detecting major adverse cardiac events in multiple 
populations.http://www.masteratheart.be
Vulnerable plaques were defined by at least two 
high-risk plaque features: low attenuation, spotty calcification, positive remodelling, 
or the napkin sign.

Endpoints and hypothesis

The primary endpoint was the prevalence of coronary plaques (calcified, 
mixed, and non-calcified plaques) on CTCA assessed cross-sectionally at 
baseline. We hypothesized that more than late-onset training, lifelong endurance 
exercise would be associated with a lower prevalence of non- 
calcified plaques than non-athletes.


Statistical analysis

Assuming and incidence of mixed plaques of 35% in subjects with an exercise 
age of 0% and 22% in subjects with an exercise age of 25 years, a sample 
size of 486 subject offers a statistical power of 80% with a 5% probability of 
Type 1 error.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
The sample size calculation was based on the likelihood 
ratio .2 test. Exercise age was assumed to be uniformly distributed between 
0 and 40 years. A univariate logistic regression assessed the association between 
exercise age and the probability of mixed plaques. It was assumed 
that exercise can be assessed in the logistic regression as a linear, untransformed 
variable, i.e. log (p/(1-p)) = a+ß×exercise age. Statistical testing is 
two-sided and assessed at a significance level of 5%. PROC POWER in SAS 
V.9.4 (SAS/STAT V.14.1) was used to calculate the sample size for a univariate 
logistic regression with exercise age as the only covariate. A total sample 
size of at least 600 subjects (200 per group) gave a margin of up to 20% for 
exclusions due to errors in the online questions or uninterpretable data.

Data were analysed using SPSS Statistics version 28 (IBM Corporation, 
Amonk, NY, USA). Normality was tested using the Shapiro–Wilk test. 
Continuous variables are presented as means (± standard deviation) or 
as medians (interquartile range) and categorical variables as percentages. 
For baseline characteristics, the between-group differences for continuous 
variables were assessed using a one-way analysis of variance or a Kruskal– 
Wallis test as appropriate with a Bonferroni post hoc correction for multiple 
comparisons. The .2 test was used to assess categorical variables. For 
CTCA findings, multiple linear and logistic regression analysis that adjusted 
for age, body mass index (BMI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total 
cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin 
(HbA1c), and family history of coronary artery disease (defined as a first 
degree relative with myocardial infarction at the age of <50 years in males 
and/or <60 years in female relatives) was performed. We calculated the 
between-group difference and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval 
(CI) for continuous and categorical variables respectively. The widths of CIs 
have not been adjusted for multiplicity, and therefore the intervals should not 
be used to infer definitive exercise effects on primary outcomes. There were 
no missing data from population characteristics, exercise testing, and CTCA 
in any group. A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Study population and baseline 
characteristics

Out of 1152 eligible candidates, 605 individuals were sampled for further 
testing. On the day of testing, 47 participants were excluded. 
Twenty-eight individuals had a BMI >27.2 kg/m², and 10 were on treatment 
with antihypertensive drugs, four were on treatment with a statin, 
and five had a medical history of cardiovascular disease. Subsequent 
analysis was performed on 558 participants comprising 191 lifelong athletes, 
191 late-onset athletes, and 176 non-athletic controls. http://www.masteratheart.be
shows the study inclusion and exclusion flow chart.

http://www.masteratheart.be
represents the baseline population characteristics. The mean 
age of all participants was 56 ± 6 years and was similar amongst all 
groups. All three groups did not differ in height, but controls had a higher 
body weight leading to a higher BMI than lifelong and late-onset athletes 
(24.0 vs. 23.2 vs. 23.5 kg/m²). Controls had a higher body fat 
percentage than lifelong and late-onset athletes (19.4% vs. 13.9% vs. 
15%). Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, 
LDL cholesterol, and HbA1c were similar in all groups. The family 
incidence of coronary artery disease was 6.3% in lifelong athletes, 6.8% 
in late-onset athletes, and 6.3% in controls. Lifelong and late-onset athletes 
were mostly cyclists with smaller groups engaged in running or a 
combination of running, cycling, and swimming. Seventy-seven percent 
of controls performed exercise =3 h/week, mostly running and 
non-endurance sports. The remaining 23% of controls did not perform 
any type of regular exercise. There was no difference in the hours per 
week of endurance exercise between lifelong and late-onset athletes, 
but both athlete groups performed more hours than controls [11 h/ 
week (10–14) vs. 10 h/week (8–12) vs. 1 h/week (0–3)]. Lifelong and 
late-onset had a similar VO2peak which was significantly higher than 
in controls [VO2peak 48 mL/min/kg (43–53) vs. 46 mL/min/kg 
(41–51) vs. 37 mL/min/kg (32–42); % predicted VO2peak 159% 
(143–177) vs. 155% (138–169) vs. 122% (108–138)].

Coronary artery computed tomography

The results from CTCA are shown in http://www.masteratheart.be
. All individuals were in sinus 
rhythm at the time of the examination. The median number of plaques 
per individual [lifelong 2 (0–5) vs. late-onset 1 (0–3) vs. control 0 
(0–4)] and the average CAC scores [8.5 (0–90.9) vs. 1.3 (0–54) vs. 
0 (0–41.6)] (http://www.masteratheart.be
) was similar between groups but lifelong athletes 
had a higher CAC percentile than controls (between-group difference 
9.6 and 95% CI 2.4–16.8). The overall coronary plaque burden assessed 
by SSS and SSI was higher in lifelong athletes than controls 
(between-group difference 0.86 and 95% CI 0.22–1.51 and 
between-group difference 0.65 and 95% CI 0.20–1.10, respectively) 
(http://www.masteratheart.be
). When considering plaque types, the distribution of calcified 
(62.3% vs. 68.4% vs. 67%), non-calcified (11.8% vs. 9.8% vs. 13.7%), 
and mixed (25.9% vs. 21.8% vs. 19.3%) plaques was similar. In comparison 
to controls, lifelong endurance sport participation was associated 
with having =1 coronary plaque (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.17–2.94), = 1 
proximal plaque (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.24–3.11) = 1 calcified plaques 
(OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.01–2.49), = 1 calcified proximal plaque (OR 
2.07, 95% CI 1.28–3.35), = 1 non-calcified plaque (OR 1.95, 95% CI 
1.12–3.40), = 1 non-calcified proximal plaque (OR 2.80, 95% CI 
1.39–5.65), and =1 mixed plaque (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.06–2.99). In comparison 
to late-onset athletes, a = 50% stenosis in any coronary segment 
(OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.20–6.50) and =50% stenosis in a proximal 
segment (OR 5.92, 95% CI 1.22–28.80) were more prevalent in lifelong 
athletes (http://www.masteratheart.be
, http://www.masteratheart.be
, and http://www.masteratheart.be
). Vulnerable plaques as defined 
by the presence of =2 high risk features were uncommon in all groups 
but a lifelong athletic lifestyle was associated with a lower prevalence 
(OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01–0.98) (http://www.masteratheart.be
).

Discussion

The Master@Heart study is the largest and most comprehensive study 
to assess the dose–response relationship between intensive endurance 
exercise and coronary atherosclerosis. The training load and cardiorespiratory 
fitness of athletic and non-athletic participants was higher 
than that of other similar studies. The three groups were free of any 
classical risk factors for atherosclerosis and carefully stratified for age 
and exercise exposure. Nevertheless, lifelong endurance sports did 
not show to offer additional protection against coronary atherosclerosis 
compared to an active, healthy lifestyle. On the contrary, lifelong 
middle-aged athletes had more coronary plaques, including more unstable 
non-calcified plaques in proximal segments (http://www.masteratheart.be
). The findings do not support the hypothesis that 
highly trained endurance athletes have a more benign plaque composition 
to explain their lower risk of cardiovascular events compared to 
non-athletes. As studies on the impact of physical activity in the upper 
range are lacking, our data open the question on whether coronary 
events are indeed less prevalent in this high-end exercise cohort, and 
if that is the case, on what explains the paradox. More and longitudinal 


Figure 1 Inclusion and exclusion flow chart of the Master@Heart study: the inclusion criteria for all participants were male sex and age between 45 
and 70 years. Athletes were defined as follows: questionnaire reported engagement in cycling =8 h or running = 6 h per week, or triathlon (combination 
of swimming, cycling, and running) = 8 h per week for at least 6 months prior to baseline. Non-athletes were defined by engagement in = 3 h per 
week of physical activity without prior exposure to regular endurance exercise. Exclusion criteria were a medical history of cardiovascular disease, 
current or past history of smoking, use of any antidiabetic drugs, statins or antihypertensive drugs, a BMI >27.2 kg/m², and a known allergy for iodine 
contrast agents.
research at the higher end of the endurance exercise spectrum is definitely 
needed.

Previous studies have investigated the dose–response relationship 
between exercise and coronary artery disease and reported a higher 
CAC burden in healthy marathon runners compared to risk-factor 
matched non-athletes.http://www.masteratheart.be
In 2017, two other studies added a relevant nuance 
that athletes presenting with coronary plaques were more likely 
to have calcified plaques, whereas non-athletes with plaques more frequently 
had mixed plaques.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
Since calcified plaques are more stable 
and less prone to rupture than mixed and non-calcified plaques, these 
findings were interpreted as benign and non-alarming.http://www.masteratheart.be
Importantly, 
these prior studies only looked at the relative distribution of plaque 
type in individuals with evidence of plaque, but differences in the absolute 
prevalence of calcified, mixed, and non-calcified plaques were not 
reported.

Contrary to these previous studies, the Master@Heart study did investigate 
the absolute prevalence of different coronary plaque types. As 
a primary finding, our data did not reveal a more benign plaque

composition in endurance athletes, neither in lifelong nor in late-onset 
athletes, than in non-athletic controls. There even seems to be a dose– 
response relationship, with late-onset athletes fitting in between lifelong 
athletes and non-athletes. The most prevalent plaque type in 
both athletes and non-athletes was calcified plaques, followed by mixed 
and non-calcified plaques. Moreover, a greater proportion of lifelong 
athletes had proximal plaques and lesions with significant stenosis, as 
well as plaques of non-calcified and mixed morphology. The non- 
calcified/mixed characteristics, a stenosis grade of =50%, and the proximal 
location of coronary plaques are all established risk factors for ischaemic 
heart disease.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
Finally, the overall coronary plaque burden, 
which is associated with higher mortality risk, was greater in lifelong 
athletes.http://www.masteratheart.be
As such, our results do not support the hypothesis that 
the observed lower risk of cardiovascular events amongst individuals 
with high cardiorespiratory fitness can be explained by a more benign 
(i.e. stable) plaque composition.http://www.masteratheart.be

Importantly, current evidence cannot relate an increased risk of ischaemic 
heart disease events in endurance athletes.http://www.masteratheart.be
Some studies 
have shown that endurance exercise reduces the risk for ischaemic 
events regardless of CAC score, and this reduction is greatest at the 
higher CAC scores.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
A first potential explanation for this apparent 
paradox can be found in our study as vulnerable plaques, which carry 
the highest risk for events, were rare and not associated with an athletic 
lifestyle. Secondly, whilst we did observe an increased plaque burden in 
lifelong athletes (i.e. SSS >0–5 and SIS >0–3), this did not extend beyond 
an SSS >10 or SIS >6 meaning that the overall plaque burden remains 
low in athletes. Thirdly, it is known that endurance athletes have 
larger coronary arteries and a greater vasodilatory potential, meaning 
that the plaque-to-vessel ratio in athletes could be lower and thus 
lead to less significant stenosis.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
Finally, despite levels of cholesterol 
and HbA1c generally falling within normal ranges, dietary habits such as 
high caloric intake and high protein diets may have contributed to coronary 
atherosclerosis in endurance athletes. Our study protocol 
planned to follow up the study subjects for 2 years to observe clinical 
events; with the given findings, we will extend that follow-up longer.

In contrast to previous studies, non-athletes in the Master@Heart 
study did not have a predominance of mixed plaques but rather a propensity 
towards calcified plaques and smaller proportions of mixed and 
non-calcified plaques. Several explanations may contribute to this. 
Firstly, studies differed in cardiovascular risk profiles in both athletes 
and controls. Smoking history was a non-negligible confounder in the 
papers by Molhenkamp et al. and Aengevaeren et al.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
Similarly, 
some athletes and controls were on medical treatment in previous 
studies, whereas the Master@Heart study excluded all individuals 
with a history of arterial hypertension, smoking, dyslipidaemia, or diabetes 
mellitus. As a result, none of the study participants was taking 
antihypertensive drugs or statins.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be


Another key area of discrepancy with previous studies is the participants’ 
training load and physical fitness. Lifelong and late-onset athletes 
from the Master@Heart study performed more training hours per 
week and had a higher METmin/week with a higher VO2peak than in 
other studies.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
Interestingly, also the non-athletes of Master@Heart 
had a higher aerobic capacity than controls in previous studies. 
Seventy-seven percent of non-athletes performed leisure-time physical 
activity. Forty-eight percent were recreational runners (<3 h/week), 9% 
were cyclists, and 18% were participating in non-endurance sports (e.g. 
football, tennis). Hence, our non-athletes exhibited a higher level of fitness 
with a higher METmin/week than the controls by Aengevaeren et al. 
(888 vs. 669 METmin/week) and a greater average percentage predicted 
VO2peak of 122% compared to 96% reported by Merghani et al.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be



Also, a difference in the type of sports between trials can be noted. In the 
paper by Merghani et al. and Molhenkamp et al., athletes were mostly engaged 
in running whilst the athletic population in the trial by Aengevaeren 
et al. was more diverse with 29% cyclists and 25% runners.http://www.masteratheart.be
There is 
evidence to suggest that runners have a higher prevalence of coronary 
plaques than cyclists.http://www.masteratheart.be
In the Master@Heart study, cyclists represented 
the largest group within the athlete population, whereas active controls 
were mostly engaged in running. The observation that lifelong athletes 
exhibited more coronary plaques, despite the potentially more favourable 
effects of cycling, strengthens the association between high endurance 
exercise exposure and coronary atherosclerosis.

Considering that a higher VO2peak is associated with a lower lipid 
volume, higher fibrous volume, and thicker fibrous cap in coronary plaques, 
we speculate that the dose–response relationship between endurance 
exercise and coronary atherosclerosis might be reverse 
J-shaped rather than a descending logarithmic function.http://www.masteratheart.be
A sedentary 
and unhealthy lifestyle carries the highest risk of ischaemic heart disease 
with a significant burden of high-risk plaques. Conversely, a lower 
prevalence of cardiac risk factors with low physical activity levels is associated 
with reduced coronary atherosclerosis but unfavourable plaque 
characteristics.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be
Our data demonstrate that a healthy lifestyle 
and above-average cardiorespiratory training and fitness prevents coronary 
atherosclerosis with a more favourable pattern of more calcified 
and less mixed or non-calcified plaques. Additional increments of endurance 
sports training load and associated increases in fitness do 
not affect the distribution of plaque types. However, lifetime intensive 
endurance training increases the overall coronary atherosclerotic burden 
with more plaques, including non-calcified and mixed plaques, plaques 
in proximal segments, and those with a significant degree of 
stenosis. In support of this premise, a recent study by Rubies et al. in 
a rodent model demonstrated that long-term intensive but not moderate 
training promoted adverse changes in the structural and functional 
properties of elastic and muscular arteries through a process mediated 
by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, miR-212/132 and 
miR-146b, and matrix metalloproteinase 9.http://www.masteratheart.be
These findings may in 
part explain why moderate and vigorous physical activity beyond a specific 
amount of time does not offer additional reduction in mortality 
risk, thereby exhibiting a nadir in the dose–response relationship.http://www.masteratheart.be
,http://www.masteratheart.be


One of the key strengths of our study was the comprehensive nature 
of the participant recruitment, which was carefully designed to minimize 
the risk of selection bias. As detailed in http://www.masteratheart.be
, more than 5000 individuals 
registered through the web portal after responding to study

advertisements in the broad community. As a result, 1152 individuals 
were eligible for inclusion in the study, which was twice the size of 
the target study population. This stringent process enabled us to include 
study participants at random, thereby diminishing the possibility 
of including individuals who registered because of personal health concerns. 
Importantly, the final sample size of the Master@Heart study remains 
twice as large as that of previous studies.http://www.masteratheart.be


Limitations

The Master@Heart study was limited to male individuals and did not 
provide insights on the exercise dose–response relationship in women. 
For statistical power, we only included men as the risk of coronary artery 
disease is significantly lower in women. All participants of the 
Master@Heart study were of White ethnicity, so our results may not 
be extrapolated to other ethnicities. All athletes denied using illicit 
performance-enhancing drugs that might induce or accelerate coronary 
atherosclerosis. However, no laboratory tests were performed to exclude 
this possibility. The primary endpoint from the Master@Heart 
study was investigated in a cross-sectional design. Therefore, a 
definitive causal relationship between endurance exercise and coronary 
artery disease cannot be made. We applied stringent inclusion criteria 
in order to minimize the influence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. 
However, we did not perform blood sampling or blood pressure 
monitoring prior to study inclusion. Nevertheless, we do not believe 
that the higher prevalence of coronary plaques in athlete was influenced 
by occult arterial hypertension or dyslipidaemia as blood pressure was 
similar between groups and athletes had even more favourable lipid 
profiles than controls. Multiple comparisons were performed between 
lifelong athletes, late-onset athletes, and controls which may increase 
the risk of Type 1 errors. Finally, lifetime training load was assessed 
using questionnaires rather than continuous tracking of training logs 
over time. We do assess training load as part of the prospective follow- 
up of all study participants, such that we will be able to disentangle 
exercise intensity and duration and their relationship with coronary 
atherosclerosis in the future. We cannot exclude that some athletes 
may have temporarily interrupted exercise training during their lifetime. 
Nevertheless, superior aerobic capacity and lowest body fat percentage 
provide indirect evidence of superior training levels in the athletic 
population.

Conclusion

Lifelong endurance sport participation on top of a healthy lifestyle is not 
associated with a more favourable coronary plaque composition. 
Lifelong middle-aged athletes had more coronary plaques, including 
more non-calcified and mixed plaques and plaques in proximal segments 
with significant luminal stenosis, than fit and healthy individuals 
with a similarly low cardiovascular risk profile. The dose–response relationship 
between endurance training and coronary atherosclerosis 
may be reverse J-shaped. Longitudinal research is needed to reconcile 
these findings with the risk of cardiovascular events at the higher end 
of the endurance exercise spectrum.
