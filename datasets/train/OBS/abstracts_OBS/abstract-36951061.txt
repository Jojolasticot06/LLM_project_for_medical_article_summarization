BACKGROUND: Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The relationship between CHIP and 
coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is unknown. The current study examines 
the association between CHIP and CH with CMD and the potential relationships in 
risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, targeted next-generation 
sequencing was performed for 177 participants with no coronary artery disease 
who presented with chest pain and underwent routine coronary functional 
angiogram. Patients with somatic mutations in leukemia-associated driver genes 
in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were examined; CHIP was considered at 
a variant allele fraction ≥2%; CH was considered at a variant allele fraction 
≥1%. CMD was defined as coronary flow reserve to intracoronary adenosine of ≤2. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events considered were myocardial infarction, 
coronary revascularization, or stroke.
RESULTS: A total of 177 participants were examined. Mean follow-up was 12±7 
years. A total of 17 patients had CHIP and 28 had CH. Cases with CMD (n=19) were 
compared with controls with no CMD (n=158). Cases were 56±9 years, were 68% 
women, and had more CHIP (27%; P=0.028) and CH (42%; P=0.001) than controls. CMD 
was associated with independent risk for major adverse cardiovascular events 
(hazard ratio, 3.89 [95% CI, 1.21-12.56]; P=0.023), and 32% of this risk was 
mediated by CH. The risk mediated by CH was ≈0.5× as large as the direct effect 
of CMD on major adverse cardiovascular events.
CONCLUSIONS: In humans, we observe patients with CMD are more likely to have 
CHIP, and nearly one-third of major adverse cardiovascular events in CMD are 
mediated by CH.
