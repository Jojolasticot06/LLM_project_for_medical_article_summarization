PURPOSE: Participation in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is low despite proven 
benefits. The aim of this study was to assess medical, psychosocial, and 
behavioral predictors of participation in a phase 2 CR.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study. Participants hospitalized 
for an acute cardiac event and eligible for CR completed in-hospital 
assessments, and the primary outcome was CR participation over a 4-mo follow-up. 
Measures included age, sex, educational attainment, smoking status, medical 
diagnosis, ejection fraction, and electronic referral to CR. Data included 
General Anxiety Disorder, Patient Health Questionnaire, Medical Outcomes Study 
Short Form-36, Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function, and Duke 
Social Support Index. Logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree 
analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Of 378 hospitalized patients approached, 294 (31% females) enrolled in 
the study and 175 participated in CR. The presence of electronic referral, 
surgical diagnosis, non/former smoker, and strength of physician recommendation 
(all Ps < .02) were independent predictors for CR participation. No differences 
were seen in participation by measures of anxiety, depression, or executive 
function. Males with a profile of electronic referral to CR, high school or 
higher education, ejection fraction >50%, and strong physician recommendation 
were the most likely cohort to participate in CR (89%). Patients not referred to 
CR were the least likely to attend (20%).
CONCLUSIONS: Lack of CR referral, lower educational attainment, nonsurgical 
diagnosis, current smoking, and reduced ejection fraction can predict patients 
at a highest risk of CR nonparticipation. Specific interventions such as 
electronic referral and a strong in-person recommendation from a medical 
provider may enhance CR participation rates.
