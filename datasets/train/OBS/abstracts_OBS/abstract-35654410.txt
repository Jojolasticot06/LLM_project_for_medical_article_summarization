Despite extensive technological advances in recent years, objective and 
continuous assessment of physiologic measures after vaccination is rarely 
performed. We conducted a prospective observational study to evaluate short-term 
self-reported and physiologic reactions to the booster BNT162b2 mRNA 
(Pfizer-BioNTech, https://www.pfizer.com) vaccine dose. A total of 1,609 
participants were equipped with smartwatches and completed daily questionnaires 
through a dedicated mobile application. The extent of systemic reactions 
reported after the booster dose was similar to that of the second dose and 
considerably greater than that of the first dose. Analyses of objective heart 
rate and heart rate variability measures recorded by smartwatches further 
supported this finding. Subjective and objective reactions after the booster 
dose were more apparent in younger participants and in participants who did not 
have underlying medical conditions. Our findings further support the safety of 
the booster dose from subjective and objective perspectives and underscore the 
need for integrating wearables in clinical trials.
