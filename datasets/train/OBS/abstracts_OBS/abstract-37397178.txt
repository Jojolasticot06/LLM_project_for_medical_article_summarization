OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether integrating breast and cervical cancer screening 
in Rwanda's Women's Cancer Early Detection Program led to early breast cancer 
diagnoses in asymptomatic women.
METHODS: Launched in three districts in 2018-2019, the early detection programme 
offered clinical breast examination screening for all women receiving cervical 
cancer screening, and diagnostic breast examination for women with breast cancer 
symptoms. Women with abnormal breast examinations were referred to district 
hospitals and then to referral hospitals if needed. We examined how often 
clinics were held, patient volumes and number of referrals. We also examined 
intervals between referrals and visits to the next care level and, among women 
diagnosed with cancer, their initial reasons for seeking care.
FINDINGS: Health centres held clinics > 68% of the weeks. Overall, 9763 women 
received cervical cancer screening and clinical breast examination and 7616 
received breast examination alone. Of 585 women referred from health centres, 
436 (74.5%) visited the district hospital after a median of 9 days 
(interquartile range, IQR: 3-19). Of 200 women referred to referral hospitals, 
179 (89.5%) attended after a median of 11 days (IQR: 4-18). Of 29 women 
diagnosed with breast cancer, 19 were ≥ 50 years and 23 had stage III or stage 
IV disease. All women with breast cancer whose reasons for seeking care were 
known (23 women) had experienced breast cancer symptoms.
CONCLUSION: In the short-term, integrating clinical breast examination with 
cervical cancer screening was not associated with detection of early-stage 
breast cancer among asymptomatic women. Priority should be given to encouraging 
women to seek timely care for symptoms.
