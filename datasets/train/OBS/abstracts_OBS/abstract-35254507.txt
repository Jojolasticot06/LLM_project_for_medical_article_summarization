1/BACKGROUND: It is still unknown whether tranexamic acid (TXA) is beneficial for the minimally invasive surgical approach to total hip arthroplasty (THA). The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of intravenous TXA in primary THA via the direct anterior approach (DAA). 
2/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 70 patients with nontraumatic avascular necrosis of the femoral head who underwent THA via the DAA between October 2017 and October 2018. Patients were divided into two groups: TXA group (39 patients received 1.5 g TXA intravenously) and control group (31 patients did not receive TXA). Patients were assessed by operative time, postoperative hemoglobin (HB) drop, transfusion rate, postoperative length of hospital stays (LHS), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and Harris hip score (HHS). 
3/RESULTS: Total blood loss, hidden blood loss, and postoperative HB drop in the TXA group were significantly lower than in the control group (p < 0.05). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of intraoperative blood loss, operative time, transfusion rate, postoperative LHS, HHS, or incidence of DVT (p > 0.05). 
4/CONCLUSIONS: TXA may reduce perioperative blood loss without increasing complications in THA via the DAA. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, therapeutic study.
