BACKGROUND: The impact of statins on COVID-19 outcomes is important given the 
high prevalence of their use among individuals at risk for severe COVID-19. Our 
aim is to assess whether patients receiving chronic statin treatment who are 
hospitalized with COVID-19 have reduced in-hospital mortality if statin therapy 
is maintained during hospitalization.
METHODS: This work is a cross-sectional, observational, retrospective 
multicenter study that analyzed 2921 patients who required hospital admission at 
150 Spanish centers included in the nationwide SEMI-COVID-19 Network. We 
compared the clinical characteristics and COVID-19 disease outcomes between 
patients receiving chronic statin therapy who maintained this therapy during 
hospitalization versus those who did not. Propensity score matching was used to 
match each statin user whose therapy was maintained during hospitalization to a 
statin user whose therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization.
RESULTS: After propensity score matching, continuation of statin therapy was 
associated with lower all-cause mortality (OR 0.67, 0.54-0.83, p < 0.001); lower 
incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 0.76,0.6-0.97, p = 0.025), acute 
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (OR 0.78, 0.69- 0.89, p < 0.001), and 
sepsis (4.82% vs 9.85%, p = 0.008); and less need for invasive mechanical 
ventilation (IMV) (5.35% vs 8.57, p < 0.001) compared to patients whose statin 
therapy was withdrawn during hospitalization.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients previously treated with statins who are hospitalized for 
COVID-19 and maintain statin therapy during hospitalization have a lower 
mortality rate than those in whom therapy is withdrawn. In addition, statin 
therapy was associated with a decreased probability that patients with COVID-19 
will develop AKI, ARDS, or sepsis and decreases the need for IMV.
