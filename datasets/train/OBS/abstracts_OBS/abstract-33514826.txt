Peritoneal dialysis (PD) possesses multiple advantages for end stage renal 
disease. However, long-term PD triggers peritoneal fibrosis (PF). From the 
nationwide analysis of diabetic PD patients (n = 19,828), we identified the 
incidence of PD failure was significantly lower in diabetic patients treated 
with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors. Experimental study further showed 
high concentration of glucose remarkably enhanced DPP4 to promote 
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the mesothelial cells. In 
chlorhexidine gluconate (CG)-induced PF model of rats, DPP4 expression was 
enriched at thickening peritoneum. Moreover, as to CG-induced PF model, DPP4 
deficiency (F344/DuCrlCrlj strain), sitagliptin and exendin-4 treatments 
significantly inhibited DPP4 to reverse the EMT process, angiogenesis, oxidative 
stress, and inflammation, resulting in the protection from PF, preservation of 
peritoneum and the corresponding functional integrity. Furthermore, DPP4 
activity was significantly correlated with peritoneal dysfunction. Taken 
together, DPP4 caused peritoneal dysfunction/PF, whereas inhibition of DPP4 
protected the PD patients against PD failure.
