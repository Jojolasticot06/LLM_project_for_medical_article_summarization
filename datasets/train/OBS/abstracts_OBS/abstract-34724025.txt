OBJECTIVE: Use Medicare claims data to evaluate risk of developing 
Guillain-Barré syndrome following vaccination with zoster vaccine.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series cohort study included 
849 397 RZV-vaccinated and 1 817 099 zoster vaccine live (ZVL or 
Zostavax)-vaccinated beneficiaries aged 65 years or older. Self-controlled 
analyses included events identified from 2 113 758 eligible RZV-vaccinated 
beneficiaries 65 years or older. We compared the relative risk of Guillain-Barré 
syndrome after RZV vs ZVL, followed by claims-based and medical record-based 
self-controlled case series analyses to assess risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome 
during a postvaccination risk window (days 1-42) compared with a control window 
(days 43-183). In self-controlled analyses, RZV vaccinees were observed from 
October 1, 2017, to February 29, 2020. Patients were identified in the 
inpatient, outpatient procedural (including emergency department), and office 
settings using Medicare administrative data.
EXPOSURES: Vaccination with RZV or ZVL vaccines.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Guillain-Barré syndrome was identified in Medicare 
administrative claims data, and cases were assessed through medical record 
review using the Brighton Collaboration case definition.
RESULTS: Amongst those who received RZV vaccinees, the mean age was 74.8 years 
at first dose, and 58% were women, whereas among those who received the ZVL 
vaccine, the mean age was 74.3 years, and 60% were women. In the cohort analysis 
we detected an increase in risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome among RZV vaccinees 
compared with ZVL vaccinees (rate ratio [RR], 2.34; 95% CI, 1.01-5.41; 
P = .047). In the self-controlled analyses, we observed 24 and 20 cases during 
the risk and control period, respectively. Our claims-based analysis identified 
an increased risk in the risk window compared with the control window (RR, 2.84; 
95% CI, 1.53-5.27; P = .001), with an attributable risk of 3 per million RZV 
doses (95% CI, 0.62-5.64). Our medical record-based analysis confirmed this 
increased risk (RR, 4.96; 95% CI, 1.43-17.27; P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings of this case series cohort study indicate a 
slightly increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome during the 42 days following 
RZV vaccination in the Medicare population, with approximately 3 excess 
Guillain-Barré syndrome cases per million vaccinations. Clinicians and patients 
should be aware of this risk, while considering the benefit of decreasing the 
risk of herpes zoster and its complications through an efficacious vaccine, as 
risk-benefit balance remains in favor of vaccination.
