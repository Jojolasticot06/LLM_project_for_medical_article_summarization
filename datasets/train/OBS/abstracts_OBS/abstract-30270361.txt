1/PURPOSE: Little is known about how health-care professionals communicate with  patients about consenting to genome sequencing. We therefore examined what  topics health-care professionals covered and what questions patients asked  during consent conversations. 
2/METHODS: Twenty-one genome sequencing consent appointments were audio recorded  and analyzed. Participants were 35 individuals being invited to participate in  the 100,000 Genomes Project (14 participants with rare diseases, 21 relatives),  and 10 health-care professionals ("consenters"). 
3/RESULTS: Two-thirds of participants'questions were substantive (e.g., genetics  and inheritance); one-third administrative (e.g., filling in the consent form). Consenters usually (19/21) emphasized participant choice about secondary  findings, but less often (13/21) emphasized the uncertainty about associated  disease risks. Consenters primarily used passive statements and closed-ended,  rather than open-ended, questions to invite participants'questions and  concerns. In two appointments, one parent expressed negative or uncertain views  about secondary findings, but after discussion with the other parent opted to  receive them. 
4/CONCLUSION: Health-care professionals need to be prepared to answer patients'questions about genetics to facilitate genome sequencing consent. Health-care  professionals' education also needs to address how to effectively listen and  elicit each patient's questions and views, and how to discuss uncertainty around  the disease risks associated with secondary findings.
