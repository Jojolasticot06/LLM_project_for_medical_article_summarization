Introduction 

The primary focus of most studies conducted on critically 
ill patients has been to ascertain the diagnosis, 
occurrence rates, and clinical outcomes among individuals 
who acquired ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 
[1]. However, recent data have shown that not all patients 
with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) admitted 
to the intensive care unit (ICU) are alike and may have 
different clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes 
[2–4]. Still, other less-known entities are frequent in 
the ICU, such as ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis 
(VAT) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) happening 
on the ward or in the ICU patients with spontaneous 
breathing but needing mechanical ventilation after diagnosis—(
so-called ventilated HAP [VHAP]) [5, 6]. Most 
of the cumulative incidence of these entities is extracted 
from clinical trials and administrative observational 
datasets that allow us to determine the effect of medical 
interventions, often of new antibiotics [7]. However, 
these data might not represent the real world, and more 
data is needed. 

Over the last twenty years, the profile of patients 
cared for in the ICU has profoundly changed [8–10]. 
Additionally, there has been an increase in ICU beds in 
some healthcare systems, making the admission criteria 
currently different from what they used to be. More 
importantly, these criteria are different among countries 
[11, 12]. A critical remark is that some patients 
on the ward might have a longer hospital stay, exposing 
them to hospital-specific pathogens, making them 
more susceptible to clinical complications than those 
treated in the ICU, where better access to multidisciplinary 
teams (e.g., infectious diseases and respiratory 
physicians, pharmacists, and even physiotherapists) 
with precise guidelines and goals of care are available 
[13, 14]. 

The European Network for ICU-Related Respiratory 
Infections (ENIRRI) network aimed to determine the 
clinical outcomes of patients who developed nosocomial 
LRTI while admitted to the ICU [5, 15]. We hypothesised 

Take-home message 
Respiratory infections remain a frequent complication in patients 
admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In our study, multidrugresistant 
pathogens were more frequently isolated in ventilatorassociated 
pneumonia patients than in other nosocomial lower 
respiratory tract infections. Notably, patients with hospital-acquired 
pneumonia which require invasive ventilation have the highest 
mortality rate among patients with nosocomial LRTI in the ICU. 

that patients with VHAP in this cohort would show the 
highest mortality rates, as has been repeatedly published 
before; however, to our knowledge, no observational 
studies have been published in Europe and South America 
evaluating this critical clinical issue. Therefore, the 
primary goal of this study is to report the clinical characteristic 
of patients with nosocomial LRTI admitted to the 
ICU and to describe microbiology and the clinical outcomes 
of these patients using a prospective multinational 
cohort. 

Methods 

We carried out a prospective, multicentric, and observational 
cohort study at 28 selected ICUs in 13 countries across 
Europe and Latin America (Argentina, Belgium, Colombia, 
Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, 
Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey) with critically ill patients 
admitted from 9th May 2016 until 16th August 2019. The 
time frame was determined by the enrolment period at 
each site (enrolment was performed during a 12-month 
continuous period in each participant site). We recruited 
consecutive patients aged 18 years or older who developed 
LRTI 48 h after admission (i.e., nosocomial LRTI), who were 
later admitted to ICU, and/or who developed LRTI during 
the ICU stay. Then, a follow-up until hospital discharge 
was performed. This study is the primary analysis of the 
ENIRRI study. The study received approval from the institution’s 
Internal Review Board (Comité Ètic d’Investigació 
Clínica, registry number HCB/2020/0370). And registered 
at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03183921. We obtained 

informed consent for patients where this was required per 
local regulations. All clinical data were anonymised and 
transferred to the coordinating centre for data curation and 
analysis. Additionally, each one of the thirteen participating 
sites presented the project to its institutional ethics commit-
tee, and it was approved. 

Patients 

Patients were eligible if they had all three conditions 
below: (1) aged 18 years or older; (2) admitted to ICU; 
and (3) having a nosocomial LRTI. We excluded readmitted 
patients. 

Data collection 

Recorded data included demographic characteristics, 
comorbidities, the time course of illness, treatments 
administered, laboratory and microbiologic data, complications 
during ICU stay, and outcomes. We determined 
disease severity by Simplified Acute Physiology 
Score (SAPS) II [16] and assessed organ failure using the 
Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [17] 
calculating both within the first day of ICU admission. 
The study protocol of this project has been previously 
published and was shared with all the local investigators 
before beginning the enrolment [5, 15]. 

Ventilatory management strategies, treatments and 
microbiological assessments were not standardised 
among centres. They were left to the discretion of the 
attending clinician, based on local guidelines and recommendations 
and supported by international guidelines [1, 
4]. 

LRTI definitions 

A nosocomial LRTI was based on clinical criteria (i.e., 
new or progressive pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs, 
except for VAT, and at least two of the following: 
temperature > 38 °C or < 36 °C; leucocytosis > 12,000 
mm3 or leukopenia < 4000 mm3; or purulent respiratory 
secretions). We classified the LRTI patients at the ICU 
as follows: (1) HAP: LRTI acquired outside the ICU 
at least = 
48 h after admission, not requiring invasive 
mechanical ventilation; (2) VHAP: LRTI acquired outside 
the ICU at least = 
48 h after the admission, requiring 
invasive mechanical ventilation due to the LRTI; (3) 
ICU-HAP: LRTI acquired at least = 
48 h after the ICU 
admission, not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation 
due to the LRTI; (4) VAP: patients admitted to the ICU 
who develop LRTI at least after = 
48 h of tracheal intubation/
tracheostomy and (5) VAT: patients admitted to the 
ICU who develop LRTI at least = 
48 h after tracheal intubation/
tracheostomy without a new or progressive radiological 
pulmonary infiltrate. 

The following diagnostic thresholds were used to confirm 
the microbiological diagnosis: bronchial alveolar 
lavage (BAL)/mini-BAL/protected specimen brush 
(PSB) = 
104 colony-forming units per mL and sputum/ 
endotracheal aspirate (ETA) = 
105 colony-forming units 
per mL or any threshold if the patient had concomitant 
antibiotic treatment when the sample was collected. 

We used the Berlin definition to classify patients with 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [18]. The 
acute kidney injury use was established using the Kidney 
Disease Improving Global Outcomes score = 
2 [19]. As 
recommended by international guidelines, septic shock 
was defined as sepsis-induced hypotension persisting 
despite adequate fluid resuscitation [20]. Sepsis-induced 
tissue hypoperfusion was defined as infection-induced 
hypotension, elevated lactate, or oliguria. Septic shock 
was identified by the following clinical features sepsis 
with persisting hypotension requiring vasopressors to 
maintain median arterial pressure (MAP) = 
65 mmHg 
and having a serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL) 
despite adequate volume resuscitation [21]. Multiple 
organ dysfunction was determined when three or more 
organ systems failed after the nosocomial LRTI diagnosis 
[17, 22]. 

Clinical outcomes at the end of antibiotic treatment 
were defined as (1) Cure: all infection-related signs 
and symptoms have disappeared or have returned to 
the pre-infection state, and chest X-ray findings show 
improvement or stabilisation at an acceptable level. (2) 
Failure: all infection-related signs and symptoms were 
not improved, or one or more antibiotics were added due 
to lack of clinical improvement; the patient died while on 
antibiotic treatment. (3) Unknown: the patient was discharged 
before the end of the treatment evaluation. (4) 
Recurrence was defined as a new nosocomial LRTI episode 
(i.e., new clinical signs compatible with pneumonia) 
confirmed by significant growth in quantitative culture 
after the first diagnosis of LRTI was made; it includes 
time until hospital discharge [23, 24]. The study protocol 
has been previously published elsewhere with all the definitions 
[15]. 

Objectives 

The primary objective of our study was to determine the 
clinical and laboratory characteristics, microbiologic features 
and outcomes of patients diagnosed with nosocomial 
LRTI in critically ill patients. The secondary aims 
included describing the clinical impact of these entities 
and comparing the different study groups. 

Statistical analysis 

We reported categorical variables as numbers and frequencies 
(%), normally distributed continuous variables 

as means (standard deviation [SD]) and skewed continuous 
variables as medians (interquartile ranges [IQR]). 
We performed .2 tests or Fisher’s exact tests to compare 
qualitative variables, Student’s t tests, ANOVAs or 
Mann–Whitney U, and non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis 
tests to compare normally distributed or skewed continuous 
variables, whenever appropriate. We used SPSS (version 
28) for data analysis. 

Results 

A total of 1060 patients were included in the study. 
The most frequent nosocomial LRTI was VAP (52.5% 
[556/1060]), followed by VAT (15.1% [160/1060]), hospital-
acquired pneumonia not receiving invasive mechanical 
ventilation (HAP) (14.3% [152/1060]), ICU-acquired 
pneumonia not receiving invasive mechanical ventilation 
(ICU-HAP) (9.2% [98/1060]), and VHAP (8.9% 
[94/1060]) (Fig. 1). Most patients were male (72.5% 
[769/1060]) with a median (IQR) age of 64 (50–74) years. 
The most prevalent comorbidities were diabetes mellitus 
(20.3% [215/1060]), chronic heart disease (27% 
[286/1060]), and chronic lung disease (22.5% [230/1060]). 
The sociodemographic characteristics of each study 
group were balanced in age, sex, and body mass index 
(BMI, Table 1). Notably, most patients received enteral 
nutrition (71.5% [758/1060]), previous muscle relaxants 
(26.8% [284/1060]), systemic steroids (24.1% [255/1060]) 
and have had surgery during the hospitalisation (43.2% 
[458/1060]). The list of characteristics evaluated in the 
cohort and its frequencies are presented in Table 1. 

Characteristics of the intensive care units and admissions 

Most of the patients were admitted to the ICU due 
to medical diagnoses (66% [700/1060]), followed by 
emergent surgery (15.4% [153/1060]), trauma (9.6% 
[102/1060]), and elective surgery (9% [95/1060]) (Fig. 2). 

The most frequent cause of ICU admission was hypoxemic 
acute respiratory failure (28.4% [301/1060]), followed 
by postoperative (13% [138/1060]) and altered 
consciousness (12.1% [128/1060]). Most of these 
patients came from the emergency department (27.4% 
[290/1060]) and the general ward (26.8% [284/1060]). 
Of those who developed hypoxemic acute respira-
tory failure, a higher proportion developed VAP (VAT: 
11.29% [34/301] vs VAP: 37.8% [114/301] vs ICU-HAP: 
9.6% [29/301] vs VHAP: 16.3% [49/301] vs HAP: 25% 
[75/301]). 

Laboratories results, severity scores, and systemic 
complications 

When comparing the laboratory results, we found that 
several organ dysfunctions and biomarkers of systemic 
inflammation differed among the study groups (Table 2). 
For instance, we found that patients diagnosed with 
VHAP had higher serum procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations 
at ICU admission (Table 2). We also found that the 
PaO2/FiO2 ratio was lower in patients with VHAP, HAP, 
and VAP. 

Patients diagnosed with VHAP had a more severe disease 
when evaluated by different severity scores at ICU 
admission (Table 2). For instance, patients diagnosed 
with VHAP showed higher scores in SOFA (VHAP: 
9 [7–12], vs VAP: 8 [5–10], vs ICU-HAP: 5 [3–8], vs 
HAP: 7 [5–9], vs VAT: 8 [6–10]) (Table 2, Supplemental 
Table 1). Notably, we found that the Clinical Pulmonary 
Infection Score (CPIS) was not different among the 
groups (in ventilated patients). Microbiological and etiological 
findings are described below and are reported in 
Table 3. Systemic complications are presented in Table 4, 
stratified by the study groups. We found that patients 
diagnosed with VAP and VHAP had a higher prevalence

Etiological diagnosis of nosocomial LRTI 

Any microbiological test was performed in 95% 
[1008/1060] of patients. 5% (52/1060) of the cohort had 
no microbiological sample. A total of 70.5% (711/1008) 
had a microbial diagnosis. A total of 16.07% (162/1008) 
had ETA-Sputum and BAL/miniBAL/PSB. The 96.3% 
(971/1008) had ETA-Sputum or BAL/miniBAL/PSB. 
The 97.8% (986/1008) ETA-sputum, BAL/miniBAL/PSB, 
respiratory virus testing, or real-time polymerase chain 

reaction (PCR) in respiratory samples. The most frequent 
sample collected during the diagnosis of nosocomial 
LRTI was blood culture in 82.5% [832/1008], followed by 
ETA and sputum culture (Table 3). Notably, the etiological 
pathogen was more frequently identified in patients 
diagnosed with VAP (75.4% [419/556]). 

The most frequently identified microorganisms were 
P. aeruginosa (18.4% [186/1008]), Klebsiella spp. (14.4% 
[145/1008]), A. baumanii (11.0% [111/1008]), methicillin-
susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) (10.81% [109/1008]) 
and E. coli (8.5% [86/1008]). We found that patients with 
VHAP and HAP had a lower prevalence of P. aeruginosa,

patients with VAT, VAP, and ICU-HAP had comparable 
etiological pathogens, with a high prevalence of P. 
aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., and MRSA (Fig. 3). 

Multidrug-resistant pathogens 

Interestingly, we found that 31% (320/1008) of the 
patients included in the study had an etiological pathogen 
that could be classified either as multidrug-resistant 
(MDR), pan-drug-resistant (PDR), extensively drugresistant 
(XDL), extended spectrum-beta-lactamase 
(ESBL), or carbapenem-resistant. Most resistant pathogens 
were classified as MDR (13.1% [132/1008]). The 
total proportion of Gram-negative roots isolated was 
50.3% (507/1008). Among these Gram-negative roots 

(i.e., A. baumanii, Citrobacter spp., E. coli, Legionella 
spp., Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., M. morgagni, 

P. aeruginosa, Proteus spp., Serratia spp.) we found 
ESBL in 14.4% (73/507) and carbapenem-resistant in 
11% (56/507). When analysing the distribution of these 
pathogens per study group, we found that VAP patients 
had a statistically significant higher prevalence of MDR 
pathogens (23.1% [74/320]), carbapenem-resistant pathogens 
(13.7% [44/320]), ESBL (13.43% [43/320]) and XDR 
(11.6% [37/320]) in comparison to the other study groups 
(Table 3). 
Clinical outcomes 

A total of 58.4% [619/1060] of the patients were reported 
to have resolved the infection. 33.4% [354/1060] patients

Discussion 

This study represents a contemporary multinational 
observational perspective aiming to describe all the 
possible nosocomial pneumonia presentations in a critical 
care setting. The main finding is the high mortality, 
especially among those with VHAP. Additionally, these 
patients presented not only a worse unadjusted outcome 
for mortality but also for morbidity with longer 
duration of their stay in both hospital and ICU. We 
also found that the etiological pathogens in patients 
admitted with nosocomial pneumonia in the ICU were 

similar among groups. However, we found that multidrug-
resistant pathogens were more frequently identified 
in VAP patients and were infrequent in the other 
groups. These findings have important therapeutic 
implications that should be further explored. 

Patients admitted to the ICU often present pneumonia 
as an infectious complication during their stay (i.e., nosocomial 
pneumonia). However, most of the work done 
has been continuously focused on only one entity: VAP. 
Nevertheless, in recent years, VAT has emerged as a new 
relevant infection in patients under invasive mechanical 

ventilation. Some authors have hypothesised that VAT is 
an intermediate infection before affecting the lung parenchyma 
[25–27]. In contrast, others have proposed VAT 
as an independent entity that does not need antibiotic 
treatment [4, 28]. Current international guidelines have 
contradictory recommendations about differentiating 
VAP and VAT and how to treat these infections [4]. On 
the other hand, as more patients are being admitted to 
the ICU without requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, 
different types of nosocomial pneumonia are now a 
growing global problem in the ICU [29, 30]. Notably, the 
clinical characteristics and outcomes of these new kinds 
of pneumonia in the ICU have yet to be appropriately 
described. 

An important finding was the higher frequency of 
infection due to P. aeruginosa in the study groups. 
Over the last 5–10 years, epidemiological studies have 
reported increased rates of Klebsiella pneumonia and 
other non-fermentative Gram-negative pathogens [10, 
31–34]. This has also resulted in resistant strains, especially 
carbapenem-resistant pathogens [35–37], our 
findings remind us that P. aeruginosa should still be considered 
a common pathogen in patients with nosocomial 
pneumonia [33]. Yet, we had a low rate of aetiology identification 
in patients without invasive mechanical ventilation, 
which could underestimate the prevalence of other 
etiological pathogens [4]. This is a common feature being 
shown in studies including patients that were not invasively 
ventilated and opens the question of how we could 
improve diagnostic yields in patients without an artificial 
airway in place [38]. An alternative to this could be PCRbased 
technologies; however, further studies are needed 
to prove the utility of these new technologies. 

Attributable pneumonia-related mortality has been and 
will be a matter of debate. Studies have been published to 
determine this effect, but the results remain unclear. One 
of the most cited studies was published almost ten years 
ago from a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 
randomised studies. Melsen et al. reported an overall 
attributable mortality of 13% in patients with VAP [39]. 
The authors reported attributable avoidable mortality in 
patients with mid-range severity and after surgery. However, 
data obtained by us suggest higher rates of mortality. 
In our study, higher mortality rates were linked with 
severity scores, especially in patients with VHAP. As the 
clinical characteristics and outcomes are different among 
the different kinds of nosocomial types of pneumonia, we 
propose to analyse attributable mortality based on the 
various clinical trajectories associated with ICU admission. 
In other words, pneumonia is not a static process, 
and dynamic changes apply and might better understand 
the attributable mortality dilemma in patients with nosocomial 
pneumonia. 

Etiological diagnosis of pneumonia represents a cornerstone 
element for adequate medical treatment. Not 
only to obtain and to identify the responsible pathogen 
promptly but also a valid identification with a significant 
sample avoids overtreatment and helps in early de-escalation 
[40]. As our results showed, patients with VHAP 
yielded poor microbiological confirmation. This can 
be interpreted in two ways. One, patients have received 
previous antibiotic treatment, which made antibiotic 
levels not allow the growth, or two, we should propose 
a more specific and invasive technique for this type of 
patient (i.e., bronchoscopy at intubation). Unfortunately, 
previous studies have shown that the performance of 
bronchoscopy is not widely part of clinical practice in 
European ICUs [41]. Yet, bronchoscopy is a valuable 
technique, and international pneumonia guidelines currently 
recommend it to improve diagnosis accuracy [1, 4]. 

Our study has some limitations that are important to 
mention. Although the study is a multicentre, multinational 
study conducted in Europe and Latin America, 
some other countries still need to be included to allow 
the generalisability of the results. There needs to be more 
representation from the Scandinavian countries where 
low resistance rates have been published. However, this 
study finds the differences and aetiology in places with 
potentially higher resistance rates, and this information 
would be valuable. Second, the diagnosis and treatment 
of the patients were not standardised per the study protocol 
among the different participating ICUs; thus, some 
fungal and virus tests were not performed, which might 
represent a potential bias. However, our results provide 
an insightful analysis of current clinical practice. Third, 
this study only recruited patients with nosocomial LRTI 
admitted to the ICU. This does not allow us to estimate 
the prevalence or incidence rate of LRTI among patients 
admitted to the hospital. Nevertheless, the proportion of 
nosocomial LRTI are well described and subcategorised 
in the VAT/VAP/ICUHAP/VHAP/HAP groups. 

In conclusion, with a prospective design analysis, this 
cohort study provides contemporary data on all the different 
types of nosocomial pneumonia that need to be 
treated in the critically ill setting. We found that VHAP 
mortality was the highest among patients admitted to 
the ICU, confirming what has been reported in previous 
clinical trials. However, the reason these patients 
have a higher mortality rate is still being determined 
and should be further explored in upcoming studies. 
Finally, we found that multidrug-resistant pathogens 
more frequently infected patients with VAP than other 
nosocomial pneumonia, which might have important 
clinical implications.
