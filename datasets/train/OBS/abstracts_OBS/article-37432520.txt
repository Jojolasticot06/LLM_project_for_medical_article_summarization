Introduction 

Sepsis is a common cause of critical illness and is associated 
with high morbidity and mortality [1–3] and, often, 
with acute kidney injury (AKI). When AKI occurs in this 
setting, it is referred to as sepsis-associated acute kidney 
injury (SA-AKI) [4, 5]. The association between sepsis 
and AKI has been studied previously [6, 7]. However, 
the lack of a reproducible and standardized consensus 
definition has limited the interpretability of available 
knowledge. 

A definition of SA-AKI was recently produced by the 
Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) 28 Workgroup 
[8]. It combines the presence of sepsis, defined by the 
Sepsis-3 criteria [9], with the presence of AKI, defined 
by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes 
(KDIGO) criteria [10], occurring within 7 days of the 
diagnosis of sepsis. 

The epidemiology of SA-AKI in the critically ill, based 
on this standardised consensus definition, remains 
unknown. Furthermore, its incidence, patient characteristics, 
timing, trajectory, treatment, and associated outcomes 
have not been studied. Guided by the ADQI 28 
Workgroup’s consensus definition and research priorities, 
we analyzed a large, granular, multicentre database 
of routinely collected electronic medical record (EMR) 
data to assess SA-AKI. 

We aimed to test the primary hypothesis that SA-AKI 
is common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit 
(ICU). We also intended to test the secondary hypothesis 
that most SA-AKI is not a disease of intensive care, 
but rather a disease that develops outside intensive care 
and triggers intensive care admission. We also tested the 
secondary hypothesis that patients with SA-AKI had 
worse renal and non-renal outcomes than non-SA-AKI 
patients. 

Methods 

Study design 

Large, multicentre, retrospective cohort study of 
granular, routinely collected, EMR-based clinical data. 

Study sites 

The study sites were 12 closed-model ICUs located in 
Queensland, Australia. The ICUs included 5 tertiary 
ICUs, 3 outer metropolitan ICUs, and 4 regional ICUs. 
The centres comprise most of the entire state-wide ICU 
capacity and include all the state-wide referral centres 
for cardiothoracic, neurosurgical, obstetric, and trauma 

Take-home message 
Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) is a common, increasingly 
prevalent problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). It occurs 
predominantly in patients admitted from the emergency department 
and is usually diagnosed within a day of ICU admission. Most 
patients with SA-AKI had stage 1 AKI and were diagnosed by low 
urine output alone, a group in which deterioration in renal function 
was uncommon. 

patients, as well as outer metropolitan and regional 
ICUs. We evaluated all adult patients admitted between 
January 1st, 2015, and December 31st, 2021. Of note, 
Queensland, Australia did not have a community spread 
of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) during the 
study dates, therefore, the global pandemic did not have a 
significant impact on the study. All patients were eligible 
if their electronic medical records were retrievable. 
We excluded patients with advanced chronic kidney 
disease requiring chronic dialysis, patients admitted with 
palliative intent, and patients transferred from another 
participating ICU. We did not exclude readmission 
episodes within the same hospital admission. 

Data sources 

Routinely collected data were obtained from all centres 
using the eCritical MetaVision™ (iMDsoft, Boston, MA, 
USA) clinical information systems. This included daily 
laboratory data, daily medications, daily microbiology, 
as well as hourly haemodynamic and hourly fluid balance 
data. Information on baseline demographics, admission 
diagnosis, the severity of illness and outcomes were 
extracted from the Australia and Zealand Intensive Care 
Society (ANZICS) Centre for Outcome and Resource 
Evaluation (CORE) Adult Patient Database (APD) 
[11–14]. The amount of missing data for key variables is 
shown in Supplementary Table S1. 

Identification of sepsis 

Sepsis was defined according to the third international 
consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock [9]. 
According to the SEPSIS-3 definition, we identified 
patients with an increase in Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment (SOFA) score by two points with proven 
or suspected infection [9]. We assumed a SOFA score 
of zero before ICU admission. Where individual 
components of SOFA were missing, no contribution 
was made to the total score [12]. The daily total SOFA 
score was calculated and an increase of two points 
over 24 hours was identified. Given the challenges 

of interpreting neurological SOFA with concurrent 
sedation, it was not included in the total SOFA [15]. 
Proven or suspected infection was defined as the 
commencement or escalation of antimicrobial therapy 
and microbiological sampling within 1 day of the SOFA 
score increase [16]. An escalation of antimicrobials was 
defined as an increase in antimicrobial ‘rank’ within 
1 day of diagnosis of sepsis [17, 18]. As demonstrated 
in Supplementary Table S2, ranking corresponds to the 
spectrum of activity with rank one indicating the lowest 
spectrum, such as first-generation cephalosporin, and 
rank four the highest spectrum, such as carbapenems or 
tigecycline [18]. 

Patients admitted post-elective surgery, trauma, or 
cardiac arrest were assumed to be receiving antibiotic 
prophylaxis in the first 2 days of admission. Thus, they were 
not classified as having sepsis regardless of their SOFA 
score. Septic shock was defined as the administration of 
a vasopressor medication and at least one blood lactate 
greater than 2 mmol/L on the day of sepsis diagnosis [19]. 
Furthermore, the dosage of vasopressor was converted to 
norepinephrine equivalent, with conversion method shown 
in Supplementary Table S3 [20]. 

Identification of acute kidney injury 

AKI was defined according to the KDIGO definition, 
with daily serum creatinine and hourly urine output (UO) 
data [10]. To manage absent hourly UO measurements 
secondary to the absence of an indwelling catheter or 
transfer outside of ICU, we performed imputation as 
described in the Supplementary Table S4. Hourly UO 
per kilogram of body weight was assessed on a rolling 
basis to identify patients who met AKI UO criteria. Every 
sliding 6, 12, and 24-h window of UO was assessed against 
AKI thresholds. We performed multiple sensitivity 
analyses assessing for systematic differences based on 
UO imputation (Supplementary Tables S5, S6). Our 
dataset did not have pre-ICU creatinine data, therefore 
the baseline creatinine was estimated using the Chronic 
Kidney Disease–Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) 
equation assuming an estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) of 75 mL/min/1.73m2 [21, 22]. Daily serum 
creatinine was compared to estimated baseline creatinine 
and values meeting definition of AKI were recorded. 
Multiple sensitivity analyses comparing different methods 
to estimated baseline serum creatinine were performed 
(Supplementary Table S7). Urine output-based or 
creatinine-based criteria or both were used to identify 
whether a patient met the KDIGO criteria for AKI. 

Identification of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury 

After individually identifying episodes of sepsis and AKI, 
we applied the ADQI 28 Workgroup SA-AKI definition. 

We compared the day of the sepsis diagnosis to the day of 
the AKI diagnosis. If AKI occurred between days 1 and 7 
after sepsis diagnosis, patients were classified as SA-AKI 
according to the ADQI criteria. Patients did not meet the 
definition of SA-AKI, if AKI preceeded episode of sepsis. 
A sensitivity analysis comparing patients diagnosed with 
sepsis or AKI, but not meeting SA-AKI criteria was performed 
(Supplementary Fig. S8). 

Outcomes 

The primary outcome was the incidence of SA-AKI. The 
secondary outcome was the timing of SA-AKI in relation 
to ICU admission. The additional secondary outcomes 
are renal, AKI severity, renal recovery status, and 
major adverse kidney events at 30 days (MAKE-30), and 
non-renal, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ICU and 
hospital mortality. Outcome definitions are provided in 
Supplementary Fig. S11. 

Statistical analysis 

Descriptive statistics were expressed as frequencies and 
proportions for categorical variables and medians with 
interquartile ranges (IQR) or means with standard deviations 
depending on their parametric or non-parametric 
distribution. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical 
data. A mixed-effect logistic regression model, 
including hospitals as a random effect, was developed to 
examine factors associated with hospital mortality and 
major adverse kidney events at day 30 (MAKE-30). The 
variables used for analysis were determined a priori and 
reflected the clinical utility of available data. The results 
of the multivariable analysis were reported as odds ratios 
(OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Given the 
large data set a two-sided p value of < 0.01 was considered 
statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed 
using R v.4.0.3. 

Ethical considerations 

This study was approved by the Metro South Hospital 
and Health Service Human Research Ethics Committee 
(HREC/2022/QMS/82024) with an individual waiver of 
consent granted. 

Results 

Incidence of SA-AKI 

From January 1st, 2015, to December 31st, 2021, 89,466 
patients were admitted to the participating ICUs. We 
excluded 1950 patients with end-stage kidney disease, 
544 patients admitted with palliative intent, and 2,503 
patients transferred between facilities. Of the remaining 
84,528 patients, 13,451 met the criteria for SA-AKI 
during their ICU admission. As demonstrated in 
Supplementary Fig. S1, the percentage of admissions that 

met SA-AKI criteria increased over time from 14% in 
2015 to nearly 18% in 2021. 

Patient characteristics 

The overall patient characteristics, inclusive of both non-
SA-AKI and SA-AKI patients, are shown in Table 1. In 
the entire cohort, the median age was 61 years, 39% were 
female, and the median body mass index (BMI) was 27.8. 
The severity of illness as measured by the median Acute 
Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) 
III score was 50 and the most common source of admission 
was the operating room followed by the emergency 
department. 

When compared to the entire ICU cohort, SA-AKI 
patients had a higher APACHE III score, were more likely 
to be admitted from the emergency department or a hospital 
ward and had a higher risk of death. Though statistically 
different, the SA-AKI group had a numerically 
similar age, sex distribution, and body mass index to the 
entire cohort. 

On the day of ICU admission, most SA-AKI patients 
required ventilation, which was similar to non-SA-AKI 
patients. Almost half received at least 1 hour of vasopressor 
therapy and almost one in ten required renal replacement 
theraphy (RRT), all of which were more common 
than in non-SA-AKI patients. Of note, diuretic therapy 
was rarely used. 

Timing and characteristics of SA-AKI diagnosis 

As shown in Table 2, the median day of sepsis diagnosis 
was the day of ICU admission, or day 1 (IQR 1–1). At 
the time of SA-AKI diagnosis, over a third (40%) of 
patients had septic shock and the median SOFA score 
at sepsis diagnosis of 7 (IQR 5–9). Most patients met 
AKI criteria on the same day as sepsis criteria, with a 
median time from sepsis to AKI of 0 days (IQR 0–1). 
Most patients (44%), were diagnosed with AKI based on 
UO alone, whereas 35% and 21% met creatinine criteria 
alone or both UO and creatinine criteria, respectively. 
At AKI diagnosis, the majority (54%) had stage 1 AKI, 
whereas only 25% and 21% had stage 2 and stage 3 
AKI, respectively. Moreover, 11% of patients received 
RRT on the day of SA-AKI diagnosis. As demonstrated 
in Supplementary Table S4, 65% (5,700) of SA-AKI 
patients with stage 1 AKI were diagnosed by UO alone, 
representing 35% of the entire SA-AKI cohort. 

Trajectory of SA-AKI 

We examined the trajectory of SA-AKI patients by 
daily serum creatinine and hourly UO over 14 days. The 
mean serum creatinine of all SA-AKI patients stabilised 
at day six of admission at a mean of 130 µmol/L from 
a peak of > 170 µmol/L in survivors and at a mean of 

155 µmol/L from a peak of 180 µmol/L in patients who 
died in hospital (Supplementary Fig. S2). Patients with 
stage 1 and stage 2 AKI did not have major fluctuations 
in mean serum creatinine over time. The mean serum 
creatinine of patients with Stage 3 AKI declined from a 
peak of almost 400 µmol/L on day one then remained 
level from day 6 onwards at 200 µmol/L (Supplementary 
Fig. S3). As most patients were diagnosed with AKI by 
UO alone, we examined serum creatinine over time by 
AKI diagnostic criteria. In patients diagnosed by UO 
alone, the mean serum creatinine remained unchanged 
and within normal range throughout the ICU admission 
(Fig. 1). These findings were consistent across each 
stage of AKI (Figs. S4, S6). Furthermore, among patients 
diagnosed by UO alone, the hourly UO data for all AKI 
stages demonstrated that normalisation of UO was typical 
and occurred within 24–48 hours of ICU admission 
(Supplementary Figs. S7, S9). 

In contrast, patients diagnosed with AKI by both UO 
and creatinine had a persistently lower UO, an elevated 
serum creatinine, the mean hourly UO never increased 
above 1 mL/kg/h (Supplementary Fig. S10), and the 
serum creatinine remained elevated at = 
200 µmol/L (Fig. 
1). 

A summary of the trajectory of AKI stages over time 
for the entire SA-AKI cohort is shown in Supplementary 
Fig. S11, demonstrating that stage 1 or stage 2 AKI 
patients decreased in number with resolution of AKI, 
whereas, many stage 3 AKI patients maintained their 
stage throughout their ICU admission. The trajectory 
of SA-AKI patients diagnosed with AKI by UO alone is 
shown in Supplementary Fig. S12, demonstrating rapid 
resolution of AKI in the majority of patients. 

Treatment during first 7 days of ICU admission 

ICU therapies were examined during the first 7 days 
of ICU admission, a duration which represents the top 
quartile of ICU length of stay. Compared to patients 
diagnosed by creatinine alone or both UO and creatinine, 
patients who were diagnosed with SA-AKI by UO 
alone were more likely to receive ventilation, but were 
significantly less likely to require vasopressors and RRT 
(Table 3). Except for ventilation in stage 3 AKI, these 
findings were consistent across all stages of AKI severity 
(Supplementary Tables S11–S13). 

In SA-AKI patients, when compared to stage 1 and 
stage 2, patients with stage 3 were less likely to receive 
ventilation, received fewer days of vasopressor, and 
were more likely to require RRT (Supplementary 
Table S14), which may represent a possible interaction 
with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which was 
not available in the data. For the entire cohort, patients

Associated outcomes 

As shown in Table 4, we examined outcomes based on 
the AKI diagnostic criteria met (UO alone, creatinine 
alone, or both). Patients diagnosed with AKI only due 
to low UO, had lower severity of maximum AKI, less 
need for RRT, higher rate of renal recovery, and lower 
mortality, when compared to diagnosis with both, 
or serum creatinine alone. To further determine the 
impact of severity of AKI at diagnosis, we compared 
outcomes for AKI diagnostic criteria met in each AKI 
severity group. In stage 1 AKI, when compared to creatinine 
alone or both, low UO consistently had lower 
severity of AKI, a much lower RRT requirement, lower 
mortality, and a MAKE-30 demonstrating few adverse 
renal outcomes (Supplementary Table S16). The relatively 
low requirement for RRT, low mortality and 
almost absence of adverse renal outcomes in patients 
diagnosed by UO alone was consistent in stage 2 and 

stage 3 AKI (Supplementary Tables S17, S18). In all 
stages of AKI, patients diagnosed by UO only had a 
three times higher chance of complete renal recovery, 
compared to those diagnosed by creatinine alone 
or both UO and creatinine. Compared to the entire 
cohort, patients with SA-AKI had a longer ICU and 
hospital length of stay, as well as a higher ICU and hospital 
mortality (Supplementary Table S19). 

For patients with SA-AKI, we created a multivariable 
logistic regression model for MAKE-30 (Supplementary 
Table S20). When controlling for patient characteristics, 
age, sex, BMI, and severity of illness, APACHE 3 score, 
ventilation requirement, and vasopressor requirement, 
an AKI diagnosis by UO criteria alone (OR 0.34; 95% CI 
0.32–0.36; p< 0.001) was associated with a significant 
decrease in MAKE-30 when compared to creatinine 
alone and both criteria.

Discussion 

Key findings 

In this multicentre study, we investigated close to 
90,000 critically ill patients and found that SA-AKI 
occurred in one-sixth of all ICU admissions, that four 
out of ten such patients were emergency admissions 
from the community and one in four from the hospital 
wards. Furthermore, the proportion of ICU admissions 
diagnosed with SA-AKI has increased year on year. 
When compared to other ICU admissions, patients with 
SA-AKI had a higher severity of illness and received 
more organ support therapies. 

SA-AKI predominantly occurred within 24 hours of 
ICU admission and the diagnosis of sepsis and AKI were 

essentially simultaneous. At diagnosis, however, most 
patients had stage 1 AKI due to low UO and relatively 
low serum creatinine. This cohort typically had early 
normalisation of UO with the resolution of AKI. Overall, 
patients with SA-AKI who met AKI diagnostic criteria 
by low UO alone had a shorter length of stay in the ICU 
and hospital, as well as lower mortality compared to the 
remainder of the SA-AKI patients, Finally, when adjusting 
for baseline characteristics and severity of illness, SAAKI 
by UO alone had significantly less MAKE-30 events. 

Relationship to literature 

To our knowledge, no other study has examined the 
epidemiology of SA-AKI in a large multicenter cohort 
of patients admitted to ICU utilising the recent consensus 
ADQI definition. Before such a definition, previous 
research demonstrated significant heterogeneity in 
patient populations, with varying incidence and mortality 
[8]. Two previously published studies, however, used 
the SEPSIS-3 and KDIGO criteria to define SA-AKI [23, 
24]. One was a single-centre retrospective study, only 
included 351 SA-AKI patients, and reported a very low 
incidence of SA-AKI at 2.8%, limiting its external validity 
[23]. Another was a single-centre retrospective study 
of the association between obesity and AKI in a cohort 
of 456 patients and did not focus on the epidemiology 
of SA-AKI [24]. Neither study examined the incidence, 
characteristics, timing, trajectory, treatment, and outcomes 
of SA-AKI in detail and a multicentric setting 
involving a large population. No previous research has 
assessed the relationship between AKI diagnostic criteria 
and outcomes in SA-AKI patients. 

Implications of the study findings 

Our findings imply that SA-AKI is a common and 
increasingly prevalent condition in the ICU. Furthermore, 
they suggest that SA-AKI mostly occurs in patients 
admitted from the community who already present to the 
ICU with a combination of sepsis and AKI. In another 
significant proportion, however, it develops in the hospital 
wards and, as such, it may be a target for earlier 
intervention. 

Furthermore, the rapid resolution, and rare deterioration, 
of renal function in SA-AKI patients diagnosed by 
UO alone suggests that, in over half of such patients, the 
presence of SA-AKI is of limited clinical importance. A 
finding highlighted by the high prevalence of renal recovery 
in SA-AKI patients diagnosed with UO alone. Thus, 
low UO may represent a physiological response to sep-
sis more than a pathophysiological marker of incipient 
organ failure. These findings may also have significant 
future therapeutic and research implications as the current 
standard of care may be sufficient to manage most

cases of stage 1 SA-AKI and prevent adverse outcomes. 
Moreover, future trials of SA-AKI therapies are unlikely 
to have sufficient power to detect effects on RRT, MAKE30, 
or mortality, if low UO alone SA-AKI patients are 
included. 

Strengths and limitations 

Our study had several strengths. First, it was conducted 
on a large cohort with a wide array of ICU admissions 
from a state-wide ICU system encompassing a 
complete range of adult critical care. This population 
is representative of the general Australian population 
and likely representative of similar populations in 
resource-rich countries. Second, our study data were 
comprehensive with highly granular data, which was 
electronically extracted from a ubiquitous clinical 
information system. All data collected were clinically 
validated and had minimal missing data points. 
Moreover, given their collection by non-research staff, 
they represent an unbiased sample. Third, although we 
utilised a novel standardised definition for SA-AKI, the 
definition is composed of the SEPSIS-3 and KDIGO AKI 
definitions, which are well established in the literature. 
As such, we were able to leverage well-recognised 
techniques to analyse a large database to identify sepsis 
and AKI. 

We acknowledge some limitations. First, the detection 
of sepsis and AKI, and therefore, SA-AKI, was done 

electronically and patients may have been misclassified. 
Organ dysfunction detected by the analysis may not have 
been caused by infection. However, our very large cohort 
of patients likely limits the impact of these unusual circumstances. 
Second, we did not classify SA-AKI into 
phenotypes as suggested by the ADQI 28 Workgroup [8]. 
Thus, our cohort of SA-AKI patients may represent different 
groups with diverging risk factors and outcomes. 
We plan to focus future work on such phenotypes. Third, 
as we could not identify which patients had CKD before 
presentation, such patients would have led to an overestimation 
of AKI when using estimated baseline creatinine 
calculation [25]. This matters, because CKD patients 
have specific features and different outcomes from those 
without CKD [26]. However, a previous study in investigated 
over 3500 of the same patients from four hospitals 
involved in this study, and using different data reported a 
low CKD prevalence of 13.5% [27]. Investigation of CKD 
patients will require additional data acquisition in future 
studies. Fourth, the censoring of an RRT and serum creatinine 
components of MAKE-30 at discharge from the 
ICU potentially introduced ascertainment bias. Lastly, 
the imputation of hourly UO data could potentially misclassify 
patients with AKI. However, the sensitivity analysis 
demonstrates no systemic differences between groups 
and reduction, not increase, in AKI diagnoses with 
imputation. 

Conclusion 

In a large cohort of critically ill patients, we found that 
SA-AKI is common in patients admitted to the ICU from 
the ED, mainly occurs within the day of ICU admission, 
and with sepsis and AKI simultaneously present. Furthermore, 
most patients with SA-AKI were diagnosed 
with stage 1 AKI and by low UO alone, which was associated 
with infrequent deterioration in renal function, as 
defined by MAKE-30. These observations provide the 
necessary epidemiological basis for interventional trials, 
whilst highlighting the need to focus on specific subsets 
of all SA-AKI patients.
