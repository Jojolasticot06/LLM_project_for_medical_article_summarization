Introduction 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a novel severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has posed 
a huge threat to global health as the largest pandemic in a century. 
Nearly 50 million people worldwide have been infected, of whom over 
1.2 million died by mid-November2020 (World Health Organization, 
2020). The pandemic is still evolving, effective treatments against 
COVID-19 are therefore urgently needed to reduce the mortality of 
COVID-19. 
Qingfei Paidu Tang (QPT), a traditional Chinese medicine, was 
formulated on the basis of one of the classics of traditional Chinese 
medicine, Treatise on Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases (Shang Han 
Zabing Lun) (National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 
2020). It is a compound prescription containing four traditional Chinese 
medicine prescriptions, each of which has been widely applied as therapy 
of common cold, fever, influenza, and other virus infections (Shi. 
et al.,2019; Zheng et al., 2014; Hsieh et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2020; Yang 
et al., 2020). Basic research also found that QPT possessed properties 
such as antivirus (Zhao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020), 
anti-inflammation (Zhao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Yang et al., 
2020; Xu et al., 2020a; Xu et al.,2020b; Wu et al., 2020), and immune 
regulation (Zhao et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a, 2020b; Wu et al., 2020), 
which might be beneficial for patients with COVID-19. Moreover, 
several small observational studies in China have suggested its potential 
effectiveness in relieving symptom (i.e., fever and cough) and preventing 
disease progression in patients with COVID-19 (Wang et al., 2020; 
Zhang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Xin et al., 2020).Therefore, QPT has 
been recommended in the Chinese guidelines for the treatment of 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) since early February 2020 and 
widely used in China (National Health Commission of the People’s Republic 
of China, 2020). However, it is unknown whether it could reduce 
the mortality of COVID-19. 
Accordingly, using the data from a national retrospective registry, 
we sought to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of QPT in COVID-19. 
Specifically, we hypothesized that QPT use would be associated with a 
lower risk of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, and tested 
it using propensity score analysis. We also assessed whether there was an 
association of QPT with the incidence of acute liver injury and acute 
renal injury during hospitalization. 
Methods 
Data sources 
In a government-mandated national registry, hospitalizations for 
COVID-19 in all the designated hospitals across China were registered 
retrospectively. Information relating to patient characteristics, treatments, 
and outcomes, in the electronic medical records (EMR), were 
required to be submitted to a system deployed by the National Health 
Commission of China, in forms of either structured database for the front 
page, or unstructured text for the progress notes, lab test results, and 
physician’s orders. By the date of May 6th 2020, over 40 thousand 
COVID-19 cases from more than five hundred hospitals have been 
included. 
Ethical approval 
The Ethics Committee at the National Center for Cardiovascular 
Diseases (NCCD)/Fuwai Hospital ethics committee approved this study 
and the Ethics Committee at the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen 
University approved the current analysis. Informed consent of individual 
patients was waived. 
Study cohort 
Among all the designated hospitals providing inpatient care for 
COVID-19 in the national registry, we excluded hospitals that were 
ineligible for data extraction or analysis for the following two reasons. 
First, the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was less than 
100. Second, the number of patients receiving QPT in the hospitals was 
less than 50. In the end, 15 hospitals were included in our study, all of 
which were located in Hubei province. 
Among the eligible hospitals, we included all patients aged =18 
years discharged between January and May 2020 with a confirmed 
diagnosis of COVID-19. We identified these patients, according to the 
International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification codes 
revision 10 (U07.100, U07.100.00x, U07.100.00 ×001, 
U07.100.00 ×002, U07.100.00 ×003), when available, or through 
principal diagnosis terms noted at discharge. We excluded patients who 
were transferred out, since the records of their hospitalizations were 
truncated. Patients who died or were discharged within 24 h of admission 
were also excluded from the analysis, because the testing and 
treatments for them were likely to be influenced due to the short length 
of hospital stay. 
Data extraction 
For each patient, the demographic characteristics (age and sex), 
prior medical histories/comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, coronary 
heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, and cancer), clinical status at admission (critical or 
not), and in-hospital death were obtained from the front-page database 
or progress notes. The vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory 
rate) at admission were extracted from the progress notes. The 
in-hospital medications (QPT, Arbidol, Ribavirin, Oseltamivir, Ganciclovir, 
Lopinavir, Lianhuaqingwen, Xuebijing, Diammonium Glycyrrhizinate, 
Methylprednisolone, Dexamethasone, and Interferon) were 
extracted from the physician orders, progress notes, and nurse records. 
The in-hospital acute liver injury and acute kidney injury were identified 
based on the front-page database, progress notes, and lab test results. 
We searched predefined keywords in unstructured text of the submitted 
medical records using Python software (version 3.6) and MYSQL 
software (version 8.0), in order to extract the data. Particularly, research 
clinicians randomly selected and reviewed 5% of the medical records in 
the hospitals with QPT use rate under 20%, to ensure the exhaustion of 
synonyms of this medication and completeness of data extraction. 
Furthermore, to ensure data accuracy, research clinicians adjudicated 
the prior medical history/comorbidities based on the progress note. 
Treatment and outcome measures 
As the treatment of interest in our analysis, QPT use was defined as 
receiving this medication for no less than three days during the hospitalization, 
according to the Chinese diagnosis and treatment protocol for 
COVID-19 (Trial Version 6) (i.e., one formula a day, three formulas were 
defined as a course of treatment) (National Health Commission of the 
People’s Republic of China, 2020). Correspondently, the study cohort 
was categorized into two treatment groups – patients receiving QPT and 
those not receiving QPT. Meanwhile, we also explored the effectiveness 
and safety of QPT between patients who ever received QPT during 
hospitalization and those who did not. 
The outcome measure of effectiveness was in-hospital COVID-19 
related mortality. The outcome measure of safety included acute liver 
injury and acute kidney injury during hospitalization. Acute liver injury 
was defined as documented acute liver injury, acute liver renal insufficiency, 
acute liver failure, hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatic coma, 
then adjudicated based on the elevation in aspartate aminotransferase, 
alanine aminotransferase, or total bilirubin. Acute renal injury was 
defined as documented acute renal failure, acute renal injury, or acute 
L. Zhang et al. 
renal insufficiency, then adjudicated based on the elevation in serum 
creatinine. 
Statistical analysis 
We described participant characteristics, treatments, and outcomes, 
with frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, while means 
±standard deviations or median with interquartile range (IQR) for 
continuous variables. The difference between groups was estimated by 
standard mean difference (SMD), and absolute values less than 0.1 were 
considered small differences (Austin and Stuart, 2015). 
We conducted a statistical power analysis in advance, based on the 
projected sample size of this retrospective registry. Assuming the in- 
hospital mortality rate was 4% in patients not receiving QPT, a total 
sample size of 9000 can achieve a statistical power of 80% at a 2-sided 
0.05 significance level to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 or below, for the 
treatment with a 30% or greater prevalence. 
We used inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) based on 
the probability of receiving treatment to make the characteristics between 
the two treatment groups comparable. The probability of 
receiving QPT was estimated by multilevel logistic regression that 
adjusted for baseline characteristics including demographics, comorbidities, 
and prior histories extracted in previous referred (Table S1), 
with hospital as a random effect. 
To assess the effectiveness of QPT, we obtained hazard ratios (HR) 
between treatment groups with developing frailty proportional hazards 
models for in-hospital death, accounted hospital as a random effect, 
adjusted for other in-hospital medications, and weighted with inverse 
probability of QPT use. We then plotted Kaplan-Meier curve in patients 
receiving and those not receiving QPT. To assess the safety of QPT, we 
obtained odds ratios (OR) with the multilevel logistic regression for 
acute liver injury and acute renal injury, which handled random effect, 
adjustment, and weight, using the similar approaches described earlier. 
We also added interaction items to explore the heterogeneity of 
effectiveness across subgroups by age (<60, 60–69, or =70 years), sex 
(male or female), and prior medical history/comorbidities (with any or 
without). In each subgroup, we recalculated inverse probability and 
reweighting separately, as aforementioned. 
We conducted two sensitivity analysis. First, we matched propensity 
score between patients receiving and not receiving QPT using the 
nearest-neighbor method, to create two groups with similar characteristics 
and sample size. Second, we added the propensity score as a covariate 
in the frailty model without weighting, to account for the 
difference between treatment groups. 
In the submitted medical records, small proportions of blood pressure 
(1.7%), heart rate (0.1%), and respiratory rate (0.2%) were missing. 
Assuming that these data were missing at random, we applied a multiple 
imputation method based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo by PROC MI 
procedure in SAS to impute missing values (Sterne et al., 2009). 
Two-tailed P values were reported with p <0.05 considered to 
indicate statistical significance. All statistical analyses were performed 
with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Results 
Study participants 
There were 9115 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the 15 designated 
hospitals in this study, with the numbers of cases in each included 
hospital ranging from 140 to 1856. After excluding 96 patients with age 
<18 years, 66 patients transferred out, and 14 patients with the length of 
stay less than 24 h, 8939 eligible cases were included in the analysis 
(Fig. 1). Of them, the average age was 55.9 ±15.6 years, and 53.4% 
(4771) were women. 4.4% (390) of patients were at critical state at 
admission, while 33.7% (3016) had hypertension, and 15.2% (1357) 
had diabetes. 
Of these patients, 2833 (31.7%) ever received QPT during hospitalization, 
with a median treatment duration of 6 (4 to 9) days. Half of the

QPT users received the first formula within 5 days after hospitalization. 
The timing of QPT use after hospitalization was shown in Figure S1. 
In the study cohort, 2568 patients (28.7%) received QPT for no less 
than 3 days and 6371 (71.3%) did not. The patient characteristics of the 
two treatment groups were provided in Table 1. Unweighted comparisons 
showed that patients who received QPT were younger (SMD>0.1). 
After adjustment for inverse probability of treatment weighting, all 
covariates were well balanced (i.e., standardized mean differences were 
<0.1). The distributions of inverse probability score weights of the two 
treatment groups were shown separately in Figure S2. 
Outcomes 
During hospitalization with a median length of stay of 15 (9 to 21) 
days, 332 (3.7%) patients died from COVID-19. The mortality was 1.2% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8% to 1.7%) among patients who 
received QPT and 4.8% (95% CI, 4.3% to 5.3%) among patients who did 
not (Fig. 2). In the unadjusted analysis, patients who received QPT were 
less likely to die than patients who did not receive QPT (hazard ratio, 
0.17; 95% CI, 0.11 to 0.25, p <0.001). In the Cox model with inverse 
propensity score weighting, all covariates in the Cox model were shown 
in Table S2. QPT use was associated with a lower mortality risk 
(adjusted hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.66, p <0.001). 
In terms of sex and age, no significant differences were observed 
among their subgroups in the associations between QPT treatment and 
in-hospital mortality (all P for interaction >0.05). Although significant 
heterogeneity in the associations between QPT treatment and in- 
hospital COVID-19 related mortality was detected between subgroups 
by prior medical history/comorbidities status (P for interaction 
=0.020), the significantly lower mortality risk for patient receiving 
QPT was observed in both subgroups (Fig. 3). 
Regarding the safety of QPT, patients who received QPT had comparable 
incidences of acute hepatic injury (crude rate, 8.9% [95% CI, 
7.8% to 10.1%] vs 9.9% [95% CI, 9.2% to 10.7%]; adjusted OR, 0.96 
[95% CI, 0.81 to 1.14], p =0.658) and acute kidney injury (crude rate, 
1.6% [95% CI, 1.2% to 2.2%] vs. 3.0% [95% CI, 2.6% to 3.5%]; adjusted 
OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.62 to 1.17], p =0.318), in comparison with those 
who did not. 
Furthermore, we also conducted an analysis of the effectiveness and 
safety of QPT between patients who ever received QPT during hospitalization 
and those who did not, and found similar results with those 
mentioned above (Table S3–4). 
Sensitivity analyses 
In addition to the IPTW analysis, we matched 3492 patients based on 
their propensity score (1746 patients receiving QPT and 1746 patients 
not receiving QPT). The two groups were well-balanced in characteristics 
and concomitant treatments (Table S5, Figure S3). The risk of 
mortality in patients who received QPT was significantly lower than in 
those who did not receive QPT (1.1% [95% CI, 0.7% to 1.7%] vs 2.7% 
[95% CI, 2.0% to 3.6%], HR, 0.40; 95%CI, 0.22 to 0.71; p =0.002) 
(Table 2 and Figure S4). In the meantime, patients receiving QPT had a 
comparable incidence of acute kidney injury (1.1% [95% CI, 0.7% to 
1.8%] vs. 1.9% [95% CI, 1.3% to 2.6%]; OR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.40 to 
1.35], p =0.327) compared with the patients who did not, but a lower 
risk of acute liver injury (5.4% [95% CI, 4.4% to 6.5%]vs. 8.1% [95% CI, 
6.9% to 9.5%]; OR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96], p =0.025). 
We also included the propensity score as an additional covariate in 
the models, in which patients who received QPT had a significantly 
lower risk of mortality than those who did not receive QPT (adjusted HR, 
0.23 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.35; p <0.001). Meanwhile, patients receiving 
QPT had comparable incidence of acute liver injury (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 
0.76 to 1.14], p =0.497) and acute kidney injury (OR, 0.74 [95% CI, 
0.50 to 1.10], p =0.133) compared with the patients not receiving QPT.

Discussion 
In this analysis based on a national registry of hospitalized patients 
with COVID-19, we first demonstrated that QPT use was associated with 
halving the risk of in-hospital mortality, without any significant increase 
in the risk of adverse effects, such as acute liver injury or acute kidney 
injury. Our findings have provided new evidence and insights regarding 
the treatment of COVID-19. 
Our study has extended the literature on the effectiveness of QPT for 
patients with COVID-19. First, this is the first study assessing the association 
between the QPT use and in-hospital mortality that is considered 
the most important and objective outcome metrics, rather than surrogate 
indicators widely used before. Second, in comparison with prior 
studies in China about QPT for COVID-19 treatment (Wang et al., 2020; 
Zhang et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Xin et al., 2020), our study has 
involved an over ninety-time larger sample size that ensured sufficient 
statistical power even for subgroup analysis. Third, using various propensity 
score approaches, we established control groups to enable 
appropriate comparisons in both effectiveness and safety of QPT. 
Fourth, this national registry included consecutive patients from multiple 
Chinese hospitals, which represented the use and effectiveness of 
QPT in real-world practice. 
The effects of QPT on decreasing mortality of COVID-19 observed in 
our study are supported by the mechanisms shown in prior experimental 
studies, which included antivirus (Zhao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020), 
anti-inflammation (Zhao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Yang et al., 
2020; Xu et al., 2020a, 2020b; Wu et al., 2020), immune regulation 
(Zhao et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a, 2020b; Wu et al., 2020), regulating 
metabolism (Chen et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020a), anti-platelet aggregation 
(Yang et al., 2020), and organ protection (Xu et al., 2020a; Wu et al., 
2020). QPT was composed of four traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions, 
which were shown to be separately effective in antivirus (Shi 
et al., 2019; Hsieh et al., 2012), anti-inflammatory (Yang et al., 2015), or 
immuno-modulating (Lin et al., 2020). QPT has multiple components 
acting on the multiple pathways. Some studies employed molecular 
network and network pharmacology to analyze the ingredients of QPT, 
and found that the key active ingredients, including quercetin, luteolin, 
kaempferol, naringenin, and isorhamnetin, could alleviate excessive

immune responses, by regulating the function of cytokines related 
pathways, such as tumor necrosis factor signaling pathways and 
mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways (Xu et al.,2020a, 
2020b; Wu et al., 2020). Further research is needed to fully investigate 
the underlying mechanism of the effect of QPT. 
In this study, we did not observe the elevated risk of acute liver injury 
or acute kidney injury among patients receiving QPT. This is consistent 
with the previous observational studies (Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 
2020; Li et al., 2020; Xin et al., 2020). Moreover, our findings are 
particularly reassuring given the complexity in comorbidities (such as 
hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease) and concomitant 
treatments (such as antivirals, corticosteroids and immunomodulators) 
observed in our cohort. Nevertheless, the long-term safety related to 
QPT still needs to be verified in future studies. 
This study has provided valuable evidence and prospects for the 
treatment of COVID-19. Currently, there are globally more than 16 
million active cases that need treatments (World Health Organization, 
2020). However, there is no evidence about any medication that could 
decrease mortality in COVID-19 except dexamethasone, which has been 
proved to be able to reduce the 28-day mortality in those who received 
mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone (Group et al., 2020; Wiersinga 
et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study implying 
that QPT could reduce the mortality risk of patients with COVID-19. Our 
findings were consistent across subgroups, and robust regardless of analytic 
methods. It is encouraging that the use of QPT can probably 
prevent tens of thousands of deaths, if our findings are further confirmed 
and applied globally. 
Limitations 
The results of our study should be interpreted in the context of 
several limitations. First, due to the nature of observational study, we 
cannot exclude the influence of residual confounders. However, using a 
propensity score approach, we included most confounders that are 
commonly taken into account in comparative effectiveness researches. 
Moreover, after the IPTW, patients who received QPT had higher rates of 
co-morbidities which was positively related to mortality risk, compared 
with those who did not receive QPT. Thus, the effectiveness we observed 
tended to be conservative, and we believed that the improved mortality 
was largely attributed to the Qingfei Paidu Tang use, rather than other 
factors. Second, our study was based on real-world data and the quality 
of data could be affected by the accuracy and completeness of medical 
records. Therefore, we only included the highly reliable variables on 
patient characteristics, treatments, and outcomes in the analysis. Third, 
our study merely collected in-hospital outcomes, therefore, we could not 
evaluate the long-term effectiveness and safety. Finally, all the patients 
in our study were from China, and the beneficial effects of QPT in other 
racially diverse populations still await further validation.

Conclusion 
Among the patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the use of QPT was 
associated with halving the risk of mortality, without raising the risk of 
acute liver injury or acute kidney injury. Further validation with randomized 
controlled trials is needed to support the use of QPT worldwide 
for COVID-19.
