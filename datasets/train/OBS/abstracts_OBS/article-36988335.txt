Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in critically 
ill patients affecting nearly half of patients in the ICU with 10% 
requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) (1). AKI significantly affects 
morbidity and mortality with patients developing severe AKI with life-threatening 

complications having especially poor outcomes. RRT 
remains the mainstay of management of severe AKI but 
the optimal timing remains controversial. Several randomized 
controlled trials have shown that the use of 
RRT in critically ill patients with AKI is highly variable 
and that starting RRT based on AKI severity results in 
over 40% of patients who spontaneously recover from 
AKI not requiring RRT while those receiving it late have 
higher mortality (2–4). However, there is no established 
definition of “early” and “late,” highlighting the need for 
better tools to define the optimal timing of initiation. 

The furosemide stress test (FST) has been evaluated 
for predicting AKI progression (5), showing that 
low urine output following FST had a high predictive 
value for AKI progression to more severe stages of AKI 
(5). One trial used the FST test to predict the need for 
RRT, but this pilot feasibility trial was negative (6). A 
further option for detecting AKI progression may be 
the use of novel biomarkers. In the past, neutrophil 
gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney in-
jury molecule 1 (KIM-1), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) 
have been evaluated for predicting RRT. In a metaanalysis, 
the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curves (AUCs) for predicting RRT were 0.720 
(95% CI, 0.630–0.803), 0.722 (0.575–0.868), and 0.668 
(0.606–0.729) for NGAL, KIM-1, and IL-18, respectively 
(7). However, heterogeneity was very high as the 
indications for initiation were variable. Recently, a new 

biomarker urinary chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 14 
(CCL14) has been shown to predict persistence of AKI 
in patients with moderate AKI (8). The AUC for predicting 
persistent AKI was 0.83 (0.78–0.87) in the critical 
care setting and 0.915 (95% CI, 0.858–0.972) in the 
cardiac surgery setting (8, 9). Importantly, not every 
patient developing a persistent or severe AKI (Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] stage 

3) develops widely accepted indications for RRT (10). 
This prospective, observational, single-center trial 
was designed to evaluate whether the combination of 
two strategies (FST test and novel biomarkers) may 
identify those patients who ultimately develop an indication 
for RRT. 

METHODS 

Study Design and Ethics 

This was a single-center observational trial conducted 
between August 2018 and May 2022 at the University 
Hospital Münster. Institutional review board approval 
was obtained by the Research Ethics Committee of 
the Chamber of Physicians Westfalen-Lippe and the 
Westfalian Wilhelms University Muenster (2019-261f-
S) on May 7, 2019. The study was conducted in accordance 
with the Declaration of Helsinki (Version 
Fortaleza, 2013). Written informed consent was 
obtained from all participating patients according to 
local requirements and legislation. 

Participants 

Critically ill adult patients with an oliguric stage 2 AKI 
were included in the study (10). At study inclusion, 
patients had to be either mechanically ventilated and/ 
or receiving vasopressors (norepinephrine/epinephrine/
norepinephrine + epinephrine = 0.1 µg/kg/min) 
to be eligible. Patients were excluded if any or several 
of the following conditions was met: advanced chronic 
kidney disease (CKD) with estimated glomerular filtration 
rate less than 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic 
dialysis dependency, need for RRT due to drug intoxication, 
pregnancy or breastfeeding, or participation in 
another interventional trial within the last 30 days. 

Study Procedures 

Prior to performing the FST, hypovolemia was excluded 
(by passive leg raising test or echocardiography) or 


treated and blood and urine samples were collected. 
FST was performed IV using 1.0 mg/kg in diureticnaive 
and 1.5 mg/kg in diuretic-pretreated patients 
(5). Two hours after the administration of furosemide, 
urine output was assessed, and patients were classified 
as FST positive (urine output = 200 mL within 2 hr following 
the application of the furosemide infusion) or 
FST negative (urine output < 200 mL/2 hr). 

Outcomes 

The primary endpoint was the development of indications 
for RRT within 7 days after developing a moderate AKI 
(KDIGO stage 2). Indications for RRT were defined as 
hyperkalemia (= 6 mmol/L), diuretic-resistant hypervolemia, 
urea serum levels greater than or equal to 150mg/ 
dL, severe metabolic acidosis (pH = 7.15), oliguria (urinary 
output < 200mL/12hr), or anuria. Secondary outcomes 
included the development of severe AKI (defined 
as KDIGO stage 3), initiation of RRT, renal recovery 
(serum creatinine [SCr] < 2 times of baseline value) at day 
90, RRT at day 90, mortality at day 90, and major adverse 
kidney events90 (MAKE90) (combined endpoint consisting 
of mortality, RRT, and persistent renal dysfunction 
[defined as = 2 times baseline SCr] at day 90). 

Biomarker Analyses 

Urine samples were collected at the day of enrollment 
prior to the FST. Samples were centrifuged and 
supernatants were frozen in dry ice, stored at –80°C 
and thawed immediately prior to analysis. Urinary 
CCL14, urinary NGAL, and plasma dipeptidyl peptidase 
3 (DPP3) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assays according to the manufacturers’ 
protocols (Sigma-Aldrich, an affiliate of Merck KGaA, 
Darmstadt, Germany; Sphingotec, Hennigsdorf, 
Germany; respectively) (11). 

The adjudicating providers and/or RRT providers 
were blinded to the CCL14 results. 

Statistical Analysis 

The study population was described by absolute and 
relative frequencies, mean and sd, where appropriate. 
Continuous variables were tested using Mann-Whitney 
U tests due to lacking normality. The association between 
categorical variables and the two groups (one 
or more indications vs no indications) was tested with 
chi-square tests. 

Critical Care Medicine 

All analyses were conducted as exploratory analyses of 
hypothesis generation and were not adjusted for multiple 
testing. All p values and confidence limits were two-sided 
and were intended to be exploratory, not confirmatory. 
In this exploratory sense, p values of less than or equal to 

0.05 were considered as statistically noticeable. 
To analyze the predictive power of selected combinations 
of biomarkers, FST and clinical covariates regarding 
the development of an indication for RRT, logistic regression 
models were fitted, corresponding receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated and the AUC 
was determined. 95% CIs were reported. For optimal 
threshold selection, the maximum value of Youden index 
was determined and associated sensitivities, specificities, 
positive predictive values (PPVs), and negative predictive 
values (NPVs) were reported. To compare two nested predictive 
models, the likelihood-ratio test was applied. The 
corresponding AUCs were compared using a bootstrap 
test for paired data. To evaluate the additional information 
the larger model gives for risk classification in comparison 
to a reduced model, we calculated the integrated 
discrimination improvement (IDI) and the category-free 
net reclassification index (cfNRI). To compare the predictive 
performance of the biomarkers between both FST 
groups (negative/positive), AUCs were compared using a 
bootstrap test for unpaired data. 

To identify possible clinical predictors for the primary 
endpoint, we performed a stepwise backward 
variable selection based on the p value of the likelihood-
ratio test with a threshold of 0.1. 

Descriptive statistics, statistical tests, and variable 
selection were performed using SPSS 21 (IBM SPSS 
Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: 
IBM Corp.). Logistic regressions, ROC analyses and 
statistical tests for model comparisons were performed 
using R (Version R-4.1.2 for Windows; R Foundation 
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; http://Rproject.
org/). AUCs were compared using the function 
roc.test in the R package pROC. IDI and cfNRI 
have been calculated using the R package PredictABEL 
(XYZ). p values and 95% CIs for IDI and cfNRI are 
provided by the function reclassification and are determined 
using a z-transformation of the statistics. 

RESULTS 

Patients 

Four hundred thirty-four patients were screened for 
eligibility, of whom 208 were included in the trial, 108 

patients with a negative FST and 100 patients with a 
positive FST (Fig. 1). 

Patient characteristics at baseline are shown in 
Table 1. The mean age was 70 years (sd, 12 yr), 
63% were men, 84% were mechanically ventilated, 
and 95% received high doses of vasopressors. At 
inclusion, the median Sequential Organ Failure 
Assessment score was 12 (Q1–Q3, 9–14) and the 
median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health 
Evaluation II score 27 (Q1–Q3, 22–35). All patients 
were postoperative, with 57% receiving an emergency 
procedure. The most common procedures 
were cardiothoracic (49%) and general surgery procedures 
(16.3%) (Table 1). 

Outcomes 

The primary endpoint of the study, development of 
one or more predefined indications for RRT, was met 
in 98 of 208 patients (47.1%) (71.4% oliguria [urine 
output < 200 mL/12 hr or anuria], 38.8% urea serum 
levels, 30.6% diuretic-resistant hypervolemia, 21.4% 
hyperkalemia, and 7.1% severe metabolic acidosis). Of 
70 of 98 (71.4%) meeting the urine output less than 
200 mL/12 hr/anuria criterion, 44 of 70 (62.9%) met a 
second indication, 19 of 70 (27.1%) were anuric, and 
seven of 70 (0.1%) showed a urine output of less than 
200 mL in 12 hours. 

The time from inclusion to development of an absolute 
indication was median 0 days (Q1–Q3, 0–1 d) and 
the time from absolute indication to initiation of RRT 
was median 0 days (Q1–Q3, 0–1 d). 

Except for renal recovery at 90 days, all other secondary 
endpoints (RRT during hospital stay, ICU 

length of stay, hospital length of stay, mortality, RRT 
at day 90, occurrence of MAKE90) were significantly 
higher in patients developing a predefined indication 
compared with patients not developing an indication 
(Table 2; and eTable 1, http://links.lww.com/CCM/ 
H319). In terms of RRT, five patients (4.5%) not developing 
an absolute indication received RRT, whereas 
69 (71.1%) developing an absolute indication were 
treated with RRT. Of 29 patients not receiving dialysis, 
in seven patients, care was changed to palliation prior 
to initiating dialysis (100% died) and in 22 patients, 
the attending intensivist decided not to initiate dialysis 
(50% died). 

Stratified analyses showed that patients with a negative 
FST and high levels of CCL14 had significantly 
higher rates of secondary outcomes except for renal 
recovery at 90 days compared with patients with a 
negative FST and low CCL14 levels or patients with 
positive FST test (eTables 2–4, http://links.lww.com/ 
CCM/H319). 

Predictive Value of FST and Biomarkers 

The AUCs for predicting the development of an indication 
for RRT were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.74–0.85) for FST, 0.83 
(95% CI, 0.77–0.89) for CCL14, 0.73 (95% CI, 0.65–0.80) 
for DPP3, and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.66–0.802) for NGAL. The 
AUC for the combination of FST and CCL14 (AUC, 
0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.92) compared with FST (p < 0.001) 
or CCL14 (p = 0.03) alone was significantly higher (likelihood-
ratio test p < 0.001, respectively). 

In patients with a negative FST, the AUC for CCL14 
for predicting the primary endpoint was 0.86 (95% CI, 
0.77–0.94), whereas in patients with a positive FST, 

the AUC was 0.66 (95% CI, 
0.52–0.80; p = 0.019) indicating 
a complimentary 
value of both parameters 
(Table 3). 

The optimal cutoff 
value (maximizing Youden 
index) for the prediction 
of the primary endpoint in 
FST negative patients was 

2.14 ng/dL (Youden index, 
0.653; sensitivity, 0.961; 
specificity, 0.692, PPV, 
0.901; NPV, 0.857).

Additional Predictive Ability of FST and CCL14 
Over Clinical Variables 

The derived clinical model identified four variables 
predictive of the development of RRT indications 
which comprised of male sex, preexisting CKD, hypertension, 
and positive fluid balance. The addition 
of FST and CCL14 results significantly improved risk 
prediction when added to the derived clinical model 
for the primary endpoint. This is supported by ROC, 
AUC, IDI, and cfNRI analyses (Table 4). 

DISCUSSION 

Although several randomized controlled trials have 
examined the optimal timing for initiation of RRT 

in critically ill patients with AKI, the answer remains 
elusive (2–4, 12). Given that commencing RRT based 
solely on AKI staging criteria results in unnecessary 
treatment in approximately 50% of patients, and 
in individuals who receive treatment “late” a higher 
mortality is observed identification of the time where 
initiating RRT is ideal has great clinical value (2, 3). 
Currently, no tools are available that can accurately 
identify patients optimal timing and consequently 
the use of RRT is highly variable given that it is often 
based on the decision of the treating physician. In 
the STandard versus Accelerated Initiation of Renal 
Replacement Therapy in Acute Kidney Injury trial 
(STARRT-AKI), clinician equipoise was used to stipulate 
enrollment of patients with a stage 2 AKI (4).

aThe following additional clinical variables were included in an initial version of the multivariable logistic regression model but were 
removed during stepwise variable selection: age, body weight, diabetes, and vasopressors. 
Dashes indicate variables were not included in the reference model. 

Approximately 30% of the patients were enrolled in 
which the clinicians were unsure whether the patients 
would benefit from RRT (4). In the late group, in 25% 
of the patients, RRT had to be started within 19 hours 
and in 24% of the patients, the start could be delayed 
up to 72 hours or longer. Thirty-eight percent of the 
patients did not receive RRT at all. Thus, physician perceptions 
on the need for RRT are imperfect and would 
benefit from diagnostic or prognostic augmentation. 
The Artificial Kidney Initiation in Kidney Injury 2 
Trial (AKIKI2) tested the hypothesis whether a moredelayed 
initiation strategy would result in more RRTfree 
days compared with a delayed strategy (13). The 
study showed that there was higher risk of mortality at 
60 days in the more-delayed group. These controversial 
trial results sparked a discussion on when to start 
RRT and whether a “wait and see” approach is preferable 
over an early initiation of RRT. However, it is still 
unknown which patients would benefit from an initial 
waiting approach and when this watchful watching can 
turn harmful necessitating a change in management. 

Other studies have investigated the predictive ability 
of FST and CCL14 for the development of progression 
of AKI. In a multicenter study including 77 critically ill 

patients with early AKI, the AUC for the progression to 
Acute Kidney Injury Network stage 3 was 0.87 (5). The 
ideal cutoff during the first 2 hours following FST was a 
urine output of less than 200mL. These data were further 
validated in an international cohort of 96 patients with 
200ml in 2 hours post FST providing a sensitivity of 74% 
and specificity of 90% for progression to stage 3 AKI. The 
2-hour urine output provided an identical AUC of 0.87 
for the progression to stage 3 in this cohort (14). In one 
small cohort of 11 patients, the predictive ability of FST in 
combination with biomarkers (NGAL, tissue inhibitor of 
metalloproteinase-2 × insulin-like growth factor binding 
protein 7) was analyzed for RRT receipt (15). The combination 
of FST plus NGAL improved the AUC from 0.86 
for FST alone to 0.88 for FST + NGAL but without significance 
(p = 0.35). Of note is that again, there is a discrepancy 
between receiving and needing RRT. 

CCL14 has been studied in the ICU setting as well 
as in a cardiac surgical cohort with a high predictive 
ability, again for the primary endpoint progression of 
AKI (8, 9, 16). However, not all patients developing 
a progression of AKI develop an indication for RRT, 
which was the purpose of this study. It is important to 
predict the need for RRT because the current standard 

of care is quite variable and initiation of RRT often 
depends on the discretion of the treating physician. 
As AKI is heterogenous in etiology, we believe that the 
combination of tests helps to improve the predictive 
value; hence, we combined the FST with CCL14. We 
also used the Youden index to determine the cutoff 
value with the best predictive value in our cohort. The 
different cutoff values in other published studies can 
be explained by investigating different patient cohorts 
and/or by predicting different endpoints (8, 9, 16). 

Here, we provide the first evidence that a combination 
of the FST with the novel biomarker CCL14 has a 
higher predictive value for the development of one or 
more predefined indications for RRT than the tests in 
isolation. Application of such a combination may obviate 
the variability in application of RRT in critically 
ill patients with AKI with the associated high mortality 
rate and resource utilization (1). Furthermore, 
these results could also help in designing future trials 
addressing the optimal time point of initiating RRT. To 
our knowledge, this is the first study that combines a 
renal stress test with novel renal biomarkers and demonstrated 
the ability of predicting one or more predefined 
indications for RRT. 

In a pilot trial that randomized FST negative patients 
into early and late initiation of RRT, no difference in 
28-day mortality could be demonstrated (6). Of 60 
patients randomized to the late group, 25% spontaneously 
recovered renal function showing that the FST 
test alone is not sufficient for detecting patients who 
will need RRT. Patient-individualized strategies using 
novel biomarkers have been shown to be effective for 
the prevention of AKI (17–19). This leads to the hypothesis 
that a similar strategy may also be useful for 
determining initiation of RRT. Here, we demonstrate 
that critically ill patients with a negative FST and high 
biomarker levels have a high risk for developing an indication 
for RRT. Therefore, the combination of these 
two tests may identify patients who are likely to benefit 
most from RRT whilst potentially avoiding escalation 
for others. 

The study is not without limitations. First, this is a 
pilot single-center observational trial where selection 
bias cannot completely be controlled for. The intention 
was to gain a first insight into the possibility of 
combining the two tests (FST and CCL14) and detect 
patients who progress to RRT-dependent AKI. 
Second, we only included surgical patients, which 

represents only a subpopulation of hospitalized severe 
AKI. However, given the diversity of surgical patients, 
the underlying sources of AKI was not uniform across 
our entire cohort, speaking to the broader applicability 
of this work. Third, not all patients developing an absolute 
indication for RRT received treatment. Besides 
the fact that treatment plan was changed for some of 
these patients, this problem is representative for daily 
routine care. A clear profile for those patients not receiving 
treatment was not detectable. Future trials have 
to address the question whether the test combination 
has also such a good predictive value in AKI of various 
pathophysiologies (20, 21). 

In conclusion, we found that the combination of 
the FST with the novel biomarker CCL14 predicts 
the development of indications for RRT. Future trials 
are warranted to investigate whether a patientindividualized 
strategy for the initiation of RRT is 
feasible.
