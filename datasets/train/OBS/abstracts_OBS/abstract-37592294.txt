BACKGROUND: All health overuse implies an unnecessary risk of patients suffering 
adverse events (AEs). However, this hypothesis has not been corroborated by 
direct estimates for inappropriate hospital admission (IHA). The objectives of 
the study were the following: (1) to analyze the association between IHA and the 
development of subsequent AEs; (2) to explore the distinct clinical and economic 
implications of AEs subsequent IHA compared to appropriate admissions.
METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted on hospitalized 
patients in May 2019 in a high-complexity hospital in Madrid, Spain. The 
Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol was used to measure IHA, and the 
methodologies of the Harvard Medical Practice Study and the European Point 
Prevalence Survey of Healthcare-associated Infections were used to detect and 
characterize AEs. The association between IHA and the subsequent.
RESULTS: A total of 558 patients in the hospital ward were studied. IHA 
increased the risk of subsequent occurrence of AEs (OR [95% CI]: 3.54 [1.87 to 
6.69], versus appropriate) and doubled the mean AEs per patient (coefficient 
[95% CI]: 0.19 [0.08 to 0.30] increase, versus appropriate) after adjusting for 
confounders. IHA was a predictive variable of subsequent AEs and the number of 
AEs per patient. AEs developed after IHA were associated with scheduled 
admissions (78.9% of AEs, versus 27.9% after appropriate admissions; p < 0.001). 
Compared with AEs developed after appropriate admissions, AEs after IHA added 
2.4 additional days of stay in the intensive care unit and incurred an extra 
cost of €166,324.9 for the studied sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IHA have a higher risk of subsequent occurrence of 
AE. Due to the multifactorial nature of AEs, IHA is a possible contributing 
factor. AEs developed after IHA are associated with scheduled admissions, 
prolonged ICU stays, and resulted in significant cost overruns.
