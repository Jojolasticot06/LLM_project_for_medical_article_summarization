Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1 (FSHD1) is among the most common muscular dystrophies,1 characterized by initial muscular weakness in the face, shoulder, and upper arms, progressing to the trunk and lower extremities.2 Ultimately, FSHD1 can lead to disability with loss of independent ambulation3 or even wheelchair dependence.4 An American team recently reported the relatively high disability rate of 23.7% in their cohort.5 In China, 12.0% of patients with genetically confirmed FSHD1 will likely lose independent ambulation within 40 years of first onset of muscle weakness; in this large-scale population studied by our group, the incidence of wheelchair reached 8.9%.3,4 The development of disability in FSHD1 may involve 3 processes, including lower extremity involvement, independent ambulation loss, and wheelchair dependence.

FSHD1 is arguably among the most challenging genetic diseases regarding understanding its underlying pathogenic mechanism and developing effective treatments because it is caused by epigenetic dysregulation due to contraction of D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat units (RU) in a disease-permissive 4qA haplotype.6 In the general population, the D4Z4 RU number typically ranges from 11 to 100–150 copies, whereas RU number is below the threshold of 10 copies in most patients. D4Z4 microsatellite units are enriched with CpG (73%),7 and previous studies have proposed that low CpG methylation of D4Z4 sequence can serve as a reliable candidate marker in FSHD diagnosis.8 In addition, it can explain several clinical features, such as penetrance variability, gender bias in severity, and asymmetric muscle wasting.9 However, whether the D4Z4 hypomethylation is associated with disease severity and FSHD1 progression has not yet been examined in detail.

In this consecutive study, through analysis of sodium bisulfite sequencing (BSS), we were able to detect CpG methylation status within the most distal D4Z4 RU in permissive 4qA haplotypes of our previously reported large Chinese FSHD1 cohort.3,10 We assessed the potential association of distal D4Z4 methylation levels with disease severity and progression to lower extremities in FSHD1 because such an association could help clinicians identify patients with FSHD1 at risk of early lower extremity involvement and disability.

Methods
Participants and Design This retrospective, observational, consecutive cohort study was conducted to investigate potential associations between distal D4Z4 methylation levels and disease severity and progression in patients with genetically confirmed FSHD. All participants were recruited consecutively over 21 years (2001–2021) from the Fujian Neuromedical Center (FNMC) in China. FSHD1 was diagnosed according to genetic diagnostic criteria as follows: presenting at least 1 D4Z4 RU (range 1–10) with a 4qA-specific FSHD1-permissive haplotype that provided a polyadenylation signal (PAS) based on a pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)–based Southern blotting assay. Healthy controls were spouses and friends of patients with FSHD1 and carried more than 10 D4Z4 RU. All healthy controls were recruited from the same institute.
Standard Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents This study was approved by the ethics committee for Medical Research of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT04369209 for this study.
Sodium Bisulfite Sequencing (BSS)–DNA Methylation Analysis To assay the regional methylation status of the most distal D4Z4 RU on the permissive haplotype 4qA in this cohort (823 patients with FSHD1 and 341 healthy controls), BSS was implemented with a 4qA allele–specific FasPAS primer that was exclusive to 4qA and not found in 10qA or 4qB (in cooperation with Genesky Biotechnologies, China). The 4qA BSS assay analyzed 10 CpGs following previous protocols.11,12 For participants carrying 4qA/B haplotypes, the distal D4Z4 methylation level was specifically measured in only 1 4qA array; for participants carrying 4qA/A haplotypes, the average methylation level was measured on both 4qA arrays as the final distal D4Z4 methylation level.12
To investigate differences in the extent of hypomethylation, all 823 patients with FSHD1 were stratified into 4 groups depending on the quartile for the percentage of CpG6 locus methylation levels. Methylation percentage quartiles were calculated such that CpG6 locus methylation levels were ordered from lowest to highest, with the first quartile (Q1; group 1) containing patients with the low methylation (LM1); the second quartile (Q2; group 2) containing patients with low to intermediate methylation (LM2); the third quartile (Q3, group3) including patients with intermediate to high methylation (LM3); and the fourth quartile (Q4, group 4) comprised patients with the highest methylation (HM). HM levels were used as a reference for comparing differences in FSHD1 disease progression affected by the degree of hypomethylation in Cox regression analyses.

Outcomes of Disease Progression The primary outcome was lower extremity involvement, which was defined based on the following 2 criteria at baseline: patient's reported symptoms and physical signs with an FSHD clinical severity scale (CSS) score greater than or equal to 3 (CSS ≥3.0) and independent ambulation loss, where participants were unable to walk without assistance, which was strictly based on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) with a grade greater than or equal to 4 (mRS ≥4).3 Wheelchair dependency was defined based as an mRS of grade 4–5 and a CSS of 4.5–5 (wheelchair use for most activities or wheelchair bound).4 Yearly follow-ups were conducted through outpatient service, telephone survey, or remote video conferences performed by the same neurologist (Z.Q.W.).
Clinical assessments of patients with FSHD1 were performed by the same examiners at study initiation and yearly follow-ups. Clinical data collected included detailed phenotypes, muscle strength, disease severity/progression, and onset ages at different endpoints (mainly obtained from patients' records or recollections). Phenotypes of FSHD1 were classified by the Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Form (CCEF); patients who were classified as category C were considered asymptomatic/unaffected patients.13 Muscle strength was assessed by FSHD clinical score (CS). Patients with severe facial involvement were diagnosed as those with a CS score of 2 on the facial muscles section; and patients with severe upper extremity (UE) involvement were diagnosed as those with a CS score of 3 on the scapular girdle muscles section or a score of 2 on the upper limb muscles section.14 Disease severity/progression was assessed by implementing specific scales: (1) FSHD CSS; (2) age-corrected CSS (ACSS), adjusted for the patient's age at examination according to the following formula: ((CSS × 2)/age at examination) × 1,00015,16; and (3) mRS, a simple 6-point assessment that included a reference to limitation in activity.17

Statistical Analysis For baseline characteristics, continuous parametric variables were expressed as mean (SDs), whereas continuous nonparametric variables were expressed as median (range). Categorical data were given as a percentage (%). Whether variables were normally distributed was confirmed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests or Shapiro-Wilk test. Then, nonparametric continuous variables were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test (for 2 groups) or Kruskal-Wallis H test (for >2 groups; statistical significance value was adjusted by Bonferroni correction); an independent t test was used for continuous variables with a normal distribution. A χ2 test (Fisher exact test when the expected value was <5) was used to compare categorical variables. Correlations between variables were assessed with the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.
The area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to assess the ability of distal D4Z4 hypomethylation within the 4qA-specific allele to predict diagnosis and disease severity/progression between patients with FSHD1 and healthy controls and between patients with symptomatic FSHD1 and patients with asymptomatic/unaffected FSHD1.

Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare the cumulative probability risk of motor function progression of lower extremity involvement and independent ambulation loss during the follow-up period between patients with genetically confirmed FSHD1 with different degrees of distal D4Z4 hypomethylation. A log-rank test was used to determine any statistical differences in the Kaplan-Meier curves between the groups.

Cox proportional hazards regression models were used initially to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in the 3 groups with relatively low methylation (LM1, LM2, and LM3) compared with the group with relatively HM at both outcomes of lower extremity involvement and independent ambulation loss. Then multivariable-adjusted models (adjusted for age at examination [younger than 20 years] [continuous variable], sex [categorical data], D4Z4 RU [continuous variable], and haplotypes of 4qA/A and 4qA/B [categorical data]) were performed to assess the association between distal D4Z4 hypomethylation and disease progression.

Statistical analyses were performed in SPSS version 22 (IBM SPSS Inc, Chicago IL). The level of statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05.

Results
Baseline Characteristics Overall, 1,164 total participants were included in the cohort, 823 of whom were patients with FSHD1, genetically confirmed by PFGE-based Southern blotting, and 341 were healthy controls. Age at examination varied widely among the 823 patients with FSHD1, ranging from 2 to 81 years (median 33); 383 (46.5%) were women. The median length of the contracted D4Z4 repeat region was 23.5 kb (range 10.0–37.0 kb) and contained 5 units (range 1–9) after formula conversion. The distribution of distal D4Z4 methylation levels was highly variable, ranging from 2.7% to 89.6%. Clinically, 722 (87.7%) patients were symptomatic (category A, B, and D) and 101 (12.3%) were asymptomatic (category C) according to CCEF; clinical scores ranged from normal to severe, with CS ranging from 0 to 15 points (median 6), CSS ranging from 0 to 5 points (median 3), and ACSS ranging from 0 to 1,500 points (median 153.8). Of the 722 patients with symptomatic FSHD1, onset age of first-ever muscle weakness varied widely, from 1 to 81 years (median 16) (Table 1).

Diagnostic Prediction Ability of Distal D4Z4 Hypomethylation To verify whether distal D4Z4 DNA methylation levels were predictive of FSHD1 status, we compared distal D4Z4 methylation levels between patients with FSHD1 and healthy controls. Notably, the methylation levels of all 10 CpGs and the average of the 10 CpGs were significantly lower in patients with FSHD1 than in healthy controls (all p < 0.0001; Figure 1A). ROC analysis revealed that the methylation levels of all 10 CpGs had a relatively large AUC, ranging from 0.8201 to 0.9684. In particular, CpG6 methylation levels were the most informative, showing the largest AUC of 0.9684 (0.9584–0.9785, p < 0.0001); at a cutoff value of 72.79%, it provided a sensitivity of 92.4% and specificity of 90.8% for distinguishing between patients with FSHD1 and healthy controls (Figure 1B). Further analysis among the 823 patients with FSHD1 showed that the methylation levels of all 10 CpGs (and their average value) were markedly lower in symptomatic patients compared with that in asymptomatic/unaffected patients (all p < 0.0001; Figure 1A). In addition, the methylation level of CpG6 showed the largest AUC of 0.7417 (0.6903–0.7931, p < 0.0001), and at a cutoff value of 67.48%, sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing between symptomatic and asymptomatic/unaffected patients with FSHD1 were relatively modest at 66.3% and 74.7%, respectively (Figure 1C). Detailed data are summarized in eTable 1 (links.lww.com/WNL/C844).

Prediction of Lower Extremity Involvement With Distal D4Z4 Hypomethylation Among the 823 patients with FSHD1, 324 (39.4%) had lower extremity involvement, while 499 (60.6%) showed no such involvement. Patients with FSHD1 with involvement of lower extremities had significantly lower CpG6 methylation levels (median 54.20%; range 14.35%–76.66%) than patients with severe facial or upper extremity involvement (median 63.71%; range 20.39%–81.95%); while among the patients with no lower extremity involvement, there was no difference in CpG6 methylation levels between patients with severe facial or upper extremity involvement and patients without severe facial or upper extremity involvement (p = 0.999, Kruskal-Wallis H test; Figure 2A). We then examined whether CpG6 methylation levels could predict FSHD1 disease progression to lower extremity involvement. At a CpG6 methylation cutoff of 65.97%, ROC analysis showed a modest sensitivity of 43.9% and a specificity of 77.0% for distinguishing between FSHD1 with or without involvement of lower extremities, with an AUC of 0.6386 (0.5816–0.6956, p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B).

Association Between Distal D4Z4 Methylation Level and Disease Severity In evaluating FSHD1 disease severity, we observed that both CS and ACSS decreased as CpG6 methylation levels increased. Specifically, median CS values were 7 (range 0–14), 7 (range 0–15), 5 (range 0–14), and 2 (range 0–13) for the LM1, LM2, LM3, and HM groups, respectively (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis H test); median ACSS values were 218.8 (range 0.0–1,500), 166.7 (range 0.0–444.4), 142.9 (range 0.0–700.0), and 71.4 (range 0.0–875.0) for the LM1, LM2, LM3, and HM groups, respectively (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis H test) (Table 2). In general, CpG6 methylation levels were negatively correlated with both CS (Spearman r = −0.392, p < 0.0001) and ACSS (Spearman r = −0.432, p < 0.0001) (Figure 3, A and B). Furthermore, categorizing each patient with FSHD1 as either the 4qA/A or 4qA/B haplotype, we found that CpG6 methylation was negatively correlated with ACSS in both groups (4qA/A haplotype: Spearman r = −0.461, p < 0.0001; 4qA/B haplotype: Spearman r = −0.479, p < 0.0001) (eFigure 1, A and B, links.lww.com/WNL/C841; eTable 2, links.lww.com/WNL/C845).

Correlations Between Methylation Levels of CpG6 and Clinical Parameters
(A, B) Correlations between methylation levels of CpG6 and (A) FSHD clinical score and (B) age-corrected CSS in all patients with methylation assessed. (C, D) Correlations between methylation levels of CpG6 and (C) onset age of first-ever muscle weakness and (D) onset age of lower extremity involvement in all patients with methylation assessed. FSHD = facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 1; CSS = clinical severity scale.

Since onset age of first-ever muscle weakness is an indicator of FSHD1 disease severity, we next investigated whether it was correlated with varying degrees of CpG6 methylation. In general, CpG6 methylation levels were positively correlated with onset age of first-ever muscle weakness (Spearman r = 0.297, p < 0.0001) (Figure 3C), with median onset ages of first-ever muscle weakness of 15 (range 2–50), 16 (range 1–52), 16 (range 1–63), and 21 (range 5–81) for the LM1, LM2, LM3, and HM groups, respectively (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis H test) (Table 2). A weak correlation between CpG6 methylation levels and age at examination was detected in the healthy controls (Spearman r = 0.067, p = 0.3439) (eFigure 1C, links.lww.com/WNL/C841).

In addition, CpG6 methylation levels were also positively correlated with D4Z4 RU number (Spearman r = 0.257, p < 0.0001). To analyze possible associations between CpG6 methylation and clinical parameters, we first divided patients with FSHD1 according to D4Z4 RU number, from 1 to 9. Among patients with FSHD1 carrying fewer (1–3) D4Z4 RU (n = 231), CpG6 hypomethylation was mild or modest and significantly correlated with onset age of first-ever muscle weakness (Spearman r = 0.371, p < 0.001), CS (Spearman r = -0.347, p < 0.001), and ACSS (Spearman r = -0.503, p < 0.001). Similarly, CpG6 methylation level was also significantly correlated with onset age of first-ever muscle weakness, CS, and ACSS in patients with FSHD1 carrying an intermediate (4–6) or large (7–9) D4Z4 RU number (eTable 3, links.lww.com/WNL/C846).

Association Between Distal D4Z4 Hypomethylation and Disease Progression Clinical assessments identified 324 (44.9%) of 823 patients with FSHD1 with lower extremity involvement (CSS ≥3.0). The proportion of patients with lower extremity involvement decreased as CpG6 methylation levels increased in patients, while onset age of lower extremity involvement increased along with methylation levels. Specifically, 52.9%, 44.2%, 36.9%, and 23.4% of patients in the LM1, LM2, LM3, and HM groups, respectively, were patients with lower extremity involvement (p < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis H test); onset ages of lower extremity involvement in these groups were 20 (range 5–65), 26.5 (range 5–54), 25 (range 8–59), and 26.5 (range 12–60), respectively (p < 0.0001; Kruskal-Wallis H test) (Table 2). Methylation level of CpG6 was also generally positively correlated with onset age of lower extremity involvement (Spearman r = 0.247, p < 0.0001; Figure 3D).
Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests of these patients with lower extremity involvement showed a median age at examination of 31 years for LM1 patients (95% CI 26–36), 39 years for LM2 patients (95% CI 36–42), 42 years for LM3 patients (95% CI 36–48), and 61 years for HM patients (95% CI 58–64). In addition, loss of independent ambulation occurred at a median age of 31 years (95% CI 23–39) in group LM1, 29 years in group LM2 (95% CI 21–37), 35 years in group LM3 (95% CI 27–43), and 52 years in HM patients (95% CI 47–58) (Figure 4). Similar trends were evident in Kaplan-Meier curves for patients with FSHD1 carrying 1–3 D4Z4 RU, 4–6 D4Z4 RU, and 7–9 D4Z4 RU (eFigure 2, links.lww.com/WNL/C842).

Kaplan-Meier Curves Showing Outcomes for Lower Extremity Involvement and Independent Ambulation Loss in Patients With FSHD1 With Different Degrees of D4Z4 Methylation Levels
(A) Significant differences in outcomes for lower extremity involvement were analyzed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests among patients with FSHD1 stratified into 4 groups depending on methylation percentage quartiles: group 1 with low methylation (LM1), group 2 with low to intermediate methylation (LM2), group 3 with intermediate to high methylation (LM3), and group 4 with high methylation (HM). (B) Significant differences in outcomes for independent ambulation loss among the 4 groups were analyzed by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) tests (all p < 0.0001). FSHD1 = facioscapulohumeral dystrophy type 1.

Compared with the 205 HM group patients, the 618 patients with relatively lower CpG6 methylation levels in groups LM1, LM2, and LM3 had generally an increased risk of progressing to lower extremity involvement in Cox regression analyses (p < 0.0001), corresponding to HRs of 3.811 (95% CI 2.703–5.373, p < 0.0001), 2.659 (95% CI 1.891–3.841, p < 0.0001), and 2.109 (95% CI 1.464–3.037, p < 0.0001), respectively. After adjusting for sex, age at examination, contracted D4Z4 RU number, and 4qA/A or 4qA/B haplotype classification, the LM1, LM2, and LM3 groups still showed a significantly higher risk of progressing to lower extremity involvement, with adjusted HRs of 3.510 (95% CI 2.289–5.382, p < 0.0001), 2.664 (95% CI 1.735–4.092), and 2.017 (95% CI 1.324–3.075, p = 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, the results of Cox regression analyses were consistent with lower CpG6 methylation associated with higher HRs for progressing to independent ambulation loss. Compared with the HM group, the LM1, LM2, and LM3 groups had adjusted HRs of 3.523 (95% CI 1.565–7.930, p = 0.002), 3.356 (95% CI 1.458–7.727, p = 0.004), and 2.956 (95% CI 1.245–7.020, p = 0.017), respectively (Table 3).

To verify whether lower methylation levels promote a rapid disease progression, we followed up 30 patients in each of the LM1 and HM groups. After a median follow-up period of 5 years (range 3–9), patients in the LM1 group displayed higher CS increases (3 points; range 1–4) and higher age-corrected CSS increases (34.2 points; range −46.6–176.5) than patients in the HM group (CS: 1 point; range 0–22, age-corrected CSS: 4.8 points; range −54.9–105.3) (all p < 0.001) (eFigure 3, links.lww.com/WNL/C843). 8 of 20 patients in the LM1 group developed lower extremity involvement, of which 1 patient progressed to independent ambulation loss, while only 2 of the 23 patients in the HM group developed lower extremity involvement. eTable 4 (links.lww.com/WNL/C847) summarizes detailed clinical data for both groups at baseline and follow-up.

Discussion
Findings in this study support the conclusions of previous studies that suggest the degree of hypomethylation at distal D4Z4 RU is a determinant of disease penetrance. In addition, this study also demonstrates that the degree of distal D4Z4 hypomethylation reflects disease severity and progression to involvement of lower extremity motor function in a large cohort of patients with genetically confirmed FSHD1. Patients with FSHD1 with lower methylation levels in distal D4Z4 microsatellites display more severe muscle weakness and a higher incidence of lower extremity involvement at a younger age compared with those with relatively higher methylation levels. Furthermore, in a follow-up of these patients with FSHD1, we found that lower distal D4Z4 methylation levels could also predict a higher risk of progression to lower extremity involvement and independent ambulation loss. Together, these findings suggest that the measurement of distal D4Z4 methylation levels may be informative for the clinical identification of patients at risk of early lower extremity involvement and progression.

Other studies examining the influence of genetic factors on disease phenotype have previously established that contracted 4qA D4Z4 RU number is inversely correlated with the severity of clinical manifestations of FSHD1.15,18 However, it is notable that FSHD1 has a characteristically high variability in disease progression, such as incomplete penetrance and a marked interindividual and intrafamilial heterogeneity.19,20 Thus, contracted D4Z4 RU number alone is insufficient to predict the severity or progression of clinical manifestations at all times. To address this issue, we examined differences in 4qA allele–specific hypomethylation and found that it can accurately predict disease severity and progression in patients with genetically confirmed FSHD1.

BSS analysis provides an averaged representation of a methylation state at each cytosine residue and has become the gold standard method for studying CpG methylation.9,10 In this study, BSS was used to assess methylation levels at a single base resolution across the most distal D4Z4 repeat region in patients with the disease-permissive 4qA haplotype to identify links between FSHD1 diagnosis/prognosis and epigenetic data of distal D4Z4 methylation levels. Consistent with previous reports,11 this assay revealed that CpG6 methylation level, particularly, was the most informative, showing the greatest difference between 823 FSHD1 samples and 341 healthy controls and between 722 symptomatic and 101 asymptomatic/unaffected patients with FSHD1, with AUCs of 0.9684 and 0.7417, respectively, in ROC curve analysis. Our findings also confirmed that reduced DNA methylation of D4Z4 RU is a reliable marker for FSHD diagnosis, as proposed in previous studies.11 However, there are several controls who showed lower mean CpG methylation levels compared with patients with FSHD1. Methylation detection errors could be relevant here. In addition, it merits consideration that patients with FSHD1 carrying the 4qA/4qA haplotype could have their methylation levels overestimated owing to methylation of both 4qA alleles. Similar issues with inconclusive diagnostic analysis of FSHD based on detection of 4qA methylation levels have also been noted in recent studies.21,22

One recent study proposed that D4Z4 hypomethylation could serve as a potentially important prognostic marker for FSHD21 but contradicted another report that found no correlation between D4Z4 methylation levels assessed by MSRE and clinical manifestation or disease severity.23 In this study, we stratified patients according to CpG6 methylation for univariate analysis of disease severity, which indicated that muscle weakness (measured by CS and ACSS) is more severe, and onset age of first-ever muscle weakness is earlier in patient groups with lower methylation levels (groups of LM1, LM2, and LM3). Specifically, LM1 group patients, who had the highest degree of hypomethylation, also showed the most severe muscle weakness and the earliest onset age at first-ever muscle weakness. In addition, our correlation analysis indicated that the degree of distal D4Z4 hypomethylation is positively associated with CS and ACSS scores and negatively associated with onset age of first-ever muscle weakness. These associations remained significant in univariate correlation analysis that also accounted for the 4qA/A and 4qA/B haplotypes. No apparently informative correlation was detected between CpG6 methylation levels and age at examination in the healthy controls, indicating no significant age effect on methylation level changes. These abovementioned observations are consistent with another recent study that demonstrated distal D4Z4 methylation level can be an indicator of disease severity in addition to its ability to differentiate FSHD1 from healthy controls.21

Among all patients with FSHD1 carrying 1 to 9 D4Z4 RU in this cohort, general analysis could not determine whether differences in distal D4Z4 methylation could influenced disease severity independent of D4Z4 RU number. Thus, further analysis of correlations between distal D4Z4 methylation levels and CS, ACSS, and onset age of first-ever muscle weakness in patients with the same contracted D4Z4 RU number showed that distal D4Z4 methylation levels were negatively correlated with CS and ACSS but positively correlated with onset age of first-ever muscle weakness for all patients with FSHD1 with 1–3, 4–6, or 7–9 D4Z4 RU. These findings indicated that epigenetic regulation may indeed independently influence disease severity in FSHD1.

Lower extremity involvement is well understood to be a prerequisite leading to independent ambulation loss and eventual progression to wheelchair dependency in FSHD1.24,25 Although our previous study suggested that differences in distal D4Z4 hypomethylation did not seem to affect the rate of progression to wheelchair dependence (i.e., advanced impairment of motor function) (p = 0.07),4 our current understanding is now expanded by evidence showing that differences in distal D4Z4 hypomethylation may reflect progression to lower extremity involvement and loss of independent ambulation in early stages of impaired motor function in FSHD1. We found that patients with FSHD1 with lower distal D4Z4 methylation levels had a higher incidence of progression to lower extremity involvement and at a younger age than patients with FSHD1 with relatively higher methylation levels (Table 2 and Figure 4A). These patients with lower distal D4Z4 methylation levels were also likely to lose independent ambulation at a younger age (Figure 4B), especially those in the LM1 group, which had the greatest extent of hypomethylation and the highest proportion and earliest onset age of lower extremity involvement. Consistent with this finding, the LM1 group contained the highest proportion of disability/wheelchair dependence (p < 0.001). Further multivariate Cox regression model showed that greater hypomethylation at distal D4Z4 was associated with higher HRs for motor symptom progression to lower extremity involvement and independent ambulation loss (adjusted for age at examination, sex, D4Z4 RU, and 4qA/A and 4qA/B haplotypes). In addition, given the chronic disease progression of FSHD,26 we performed a follow-up (median 5 years) between the LM1 and HM groups (i.e., those groups with the greatest difference of methylation levels). Of interest, the follow-up data indicated that the LM1 group had more pronounced increases in disease severity and a higher proportion of lower extremity involvement than the HM group, indicating that lower methylation levels do promote more rapid disease progression. These results suggest that a higher extent of distal D4Z4 hypomethylation may increase the rate of motor function progression to lower extremities.

This study has several limitations. Of most importance, assessment of correlations between distal D4Z4 methylation levels and disease severity and progression cannot be compared with other studies examining D4Z4 methylation because of the selection of different regions within the D4Z4 repeat region. However, our analysis captured the most distal D4Z4 repeat and the adjacent A-type locus, which has been correlated with the pathologic expression of DUX4 in contracted D4Z4 regions. This region was also examined by Calandra et al.11 Another limitation is that the final distal methylation levels might be diluted in patients with FSHD1 with the 4qA/A haplotype because of the inclusion of noncontracted D4Z4 repeats. However, no significant differences were identified between the results of correlation analysis for the 4qA/A haplotype and those of the 4qA/B haplotype. Finally, distal D4Z4 methylation levels were checked only when the participants were enrolled in the study. Future studies will include serial follow-ups to quantify changes in distal D4Z4 methylation levels along with evaluations of motor function to further delineate changes in D4Z4 hypomethylation that occur over the course of FSHD1.

In summary, our results suggest that distal D4Z4 methylation levels detected by BSS could serve as a noninvasive, easily accessible biomarker to predict disease severity and a potentially prognostic marker for FSHD1. Consistent with the conclusions of previous studies, our data support that D4Z4 hypomethylation is a reliable auxiliary diagnostic indicator for use in FSHD diagnostic workflows. Future prospective follow-up study designs that incorporate other factors such as contracted D4Z4 repeat units and/or disease duration should help to develop a prognostic risk model for FSHD and provide evidence to guide the management of patients with different methylation levels.
