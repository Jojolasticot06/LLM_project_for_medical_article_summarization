OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of CUD with self-harm, suicide, and overall 
mortality risk in youths with mood disorders.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A population-based retrospective cohort study 
was performed using Ohio Medicaid claims data linked with death certificate 
data. The analysis included 204 780 youths (aged 10-24 years) with a diagnosis 
of mood disorders between July 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, who were followed 
up to 365 days from the index diagnostic claim until the end of enrollment, the 
self-harm event, or death. Statistical analysis was performed from April 4 to 
July 17, 2020.
EXPOSURE: Physician-diagnosed CUD defined using outpatient and inpatient claims 
from 180 days prior to the index mood disorder diagnostic claim through the 
365-day follow-up period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Nonfatal self-harm, all-cause mortality, and deaths 
by suicide, unintentional overdose, motor vehicle crashes, and homicide. 
Marginal structural models using inverse probability weights examined 
associations between CUD and outcomes.
RESULTS: This study included 204 780 youths (133 081 female participants 
[65.0%]; mean [SD] age at the time of mood disorder diagnosis, 17.2 [4.10] 
years). Cannabis use disorder was documented for 10.3% of youths with mood 
disorders (n = 21 040) and was significantly associated with older age (14-18 
years vs 10-13 years: adjusted risk ratio [ARR], 9.35; 95% CI, 8.57-10.19; and 
19-24 years vs 10-13 years: ARR, 11.22; 95% CI, 10.27-12.26), male sex (ARR, 
1.79; 95% CI, 1.74-1.84), Black race (ARR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.35-1.44), bipolar or 
other mood disorders (bipolar disorders: ARR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.21-1.29; other 
mood disorders: ARR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15-1.25), prior history of self-harm (ARR, 
1.66; 95% CI, 1.52-1.82), previous mental health outpatient visits (ARR, 1.26; 
95% CI, 1.22-1.30), psychiatric hospitalizations (ARR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.57-1.76), 
and mental health emergency department visits (ARR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.47-1.61). 
Cannabis use disorder was significantly associated with nonfatal self-harm 
(adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 3.28; 95% CI, 2.55-4.22) and all-cause mortality 
(AHR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.13-2.24), including death by unintentional overdose (AHR, 
2.40; 95% CI, 1.39-4.16) and homicide (AHR, 3.23; 95% CI, 1.22-8.59). Although 
CUD was associated with suicide in the unadjusted model, it was not 
significantly associated in adjusted models.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cannabis use disorder is a common comorbidity and 
risk marker for self-harm, all-cause mortality, and death by unintentional 
overdose and homicide among youths with mood disorders. These findings should be 
considered as states contemplate legalizing medical and recreational marijuana, 
both of which are associated with increased CUD.
