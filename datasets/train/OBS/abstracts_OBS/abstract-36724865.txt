1/OBJECTIVES: To describe the epidemiological, clinical, and household transmission characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 cases in Shanghai, China. 
2/METHODS: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in Shanghai from March-May 2022 were enrolled in this retrospective, multicenter cohort study. The symptoms and the risk factors associated with disease severity were analyzed. 
3/RESULTS: In total, 2620 cases (age range, 24 days-17 years) were enrolled in this study. Of these, 1011 (38.6%) were asymptomatic, whereas 1415 (54.0%), 190 (7.3%), and 4 (0.2%) patients developed mild, moderate, and severe illnesses, respectively. Household infection rate was negatively correlated with household vaccination coverage. Children aged 0-3 years, those who are unvaccinated, those with underlying diseases, and overweight/obese children had a higher risk of developing moderate to severe disease than children aged 12-17 years, those who were vaccinated, those without any underlying disease, and those with normal weight, respectively (all P <0.05). A prolonged duration of viral shedding was associated with disease severity, presence of underlying diseases, vaccination status, and younger age (all P <0.05). 
4/CONCLUSION: Children aged younger than 3 years who were not eligible for vaccination had a high risk of developing moderate to severe COVID-19 with a prolonged duration of viral shedding. Vaccination could protect children from COVID-19 at the household level.
