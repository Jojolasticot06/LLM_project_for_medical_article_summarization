BACKGROUND: Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 antibody approved for treating metastatic 
melanoma (MM), for which still limited evidence is available on the correlation 
between drug exposure and patient outcomes.
METHODS: In this observational retrospective study, we assessed whether 
nivolumab concentration is associated with treatment response in 88 patients 
with MM and if the patient's genetic profile plays a role in this association.
RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant correlation between nivolumab 
serum concentration and clinical outcomes, measured as overall and 
progression-free survival. Moreover, patients who achieved a clinical or partial 
response tended to have higher levels of nivolumab than those who reached stable 
disease or had disease progression. However, the difference was not 
statistically significant. In particular, patients who reached a clinical 
response had a significantly higher concentration of nivolumab and presented a 
distinct genetic signature, with more marked activation of ICOS and other genes 
involved in effector T-cells mediated proinflammatory pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, these preliminary results show that in patients with 
MM, nivolumab concentration correlates with clinical outcomes and is associated 
with an increased expression of ICOS and other genes involved in the activation 
of T effectors cells.
