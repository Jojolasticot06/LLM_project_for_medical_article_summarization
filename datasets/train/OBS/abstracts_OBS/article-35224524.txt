Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating, particularly for older individuals.1, 2 Accelerated vaccine development via different platforms has been an important advancement in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the mRNA-based vaccines mRNA-1273 (Spikevax; Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Comirnaty; Pfizer–BioNTech) showed significant serological responses after the prime dose in clinical trials,3, 4 coupled with the scarcity of their supply globally, public health measures in several countries involved rationing these vaccines by deferring boost doses in order to prioritise administering the first dose to as many high-risk individuals as possible.5 This approach resulted in delayed administration of the second dose (relative to the 3–4-week interval studied in clinical trials) and heterologous prime-boost vaccination (whereby the second dose is different from the first dose; also known as mixing). Data on the serological response associated with these approaches are scarce, particularly in frail, older people. This uncertainty is concerning because of immunosenescence in older populations, resulting in diminished immunological capacity to respond not only to infections, underlying their heightened risk for severe COVID-19, but also to vaccines, potentially contributing to the ongoing risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In Québec, Canada, the vaccination strategy mandated by the provincial government resulted in an extended interval of 16 weeks between first and second vaccine doses for older people (aged ≥65 years) residing in long-term care. Although this policy widely expanded first-dose protection to this high-risk population, resulting in decreased hospital admissions and deaths due to COVID-19,6 the antigenicity of this strategy beyond the first dose in frail, older people is unknown. Specifically, due to the urgent need to vaccinate older people in long-term care facilities, all residents wishing to be vaccinated received the vaccine, regardless of their previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status. At present, it is unclear how previous infection affects the magnitude and kinetics of the vaccine response in this population. Additionally, because of the variability in vaccine supply, the boost doses administered were either the same (homologous) or different (heterologous) from the prime doses, although data on the interchangeability of mRNA vaccines were not widely available at the time of the study. The UNCoVER (UNderstanding Co-V2 Vaccination in Elderly Residents) study aimed to evaluate serological responses to a real-world COVID-19 vaccination strategy in older people residing in long-term care facilities. Here, we report the interim results of this prospective observational cohort study. 
Methods 
Study procedure and participants 
In Québec, Canada, the COVID-19 vaccination campaign was launched by the provincial Ministry of Health on Dec 14, 2020, with people aged 65 years and older residing in long-term care facilities prioritised to receive available mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2 vaccine doses. This study was done across 12 long-term care facilities of the Montréal Centre-Sud – Integrated University Health and Social Services Centre (CIUSSS du Centre-Sud-de-l'Île-de-Montréal), Montréal, QC, Canada, and was approved by its research ethics board (Comité d'éthique de la recherche Vieillissement-Neuroimagerie, protocol number 20-21-36 MP; appendix 2 pp 1–4). The long-term care facilities included in this study (termed residential and long-term care centres, known as CHSLDs [centre d'hébergement et de soins de longue durée] in Quebec) focus primarily on the care of older people requiring more than 3 h of care daily. Because of the limited vaccine supply, the province-wide prioritisation strategy consisted of administering the first dose to as many long-term care residents as possible, which necessitated delayed administration of the second dose by up to 16 weeks (±2 days) after the first dose, rather than the 3-week or 4-week interval used in the clinical trials. At the time of the second dose, the mRNA vaccine used could be either homologous or heterologous to the first one, based on availability. All older residents in participating long-term care facilities were eligible for inclusion in this study. Residents deemed unfit by the health-care staff (at the long-term care facilities) to provide blood samples for immunological analyses were excluded from the study. Participating long-term care residents or their legally authorised representatives provided verbal informed consent before enrolment. Clinical data were sourced from the individual's medical chart stored at the participating long-term care facility and were collected at baseline and updated at the timepoints mentioned below. Clinical data collection included information on the participant's medical history (ie, comorbidities), past SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis based on RT-PCR test results done in a diagnostic microbiology laboratory, and COVID-19 vaccine administration. Frailty status was assessed with the Clinical Frailty Scale completed by the nursing staff.7 Blood samples were collected at the following timepoints (±2 days), subject to availability of long-term care facility staff and scheduling: within 1 day of the first dose administration, before the administration of the vaccine (t1); at approximately 4 weeks after the first dose, which coincides with the timing of the putative second dose, as done in the clinical trials (t2); at 6–10 weeks after the first dose (t3); up to 2 days before the administration of the second dose, 16 weeks after the prime dose (t4); and at 4 weeks after the second dose (t5). These time measurements constitute this interim report. Due to logistical constraints under emergency pandemic measures, this observational study established two cohorts. In the first cohort, blood samples were collected before administration of the first vaccine dose (t1) and at each timepoint thereafter. In the second cohort, blood samples were only collected from the t2 timepoint onwards. Because of this difference in sampling, we did our analyses in the first cohort (the discovery cohort), with validation in the second cohort (the confirmatory cohort), when applicable. Thus, this interim analysis was done from Dec 31, 2020, to June 9, 2021. Longitudinal data collection at later timepoints is in progress. 
Samples 
Blood was collected in acid citrate dextrose from participants and processed within 6 h of collection. Plasma was stored at −80°C until ready for batch testing. 
Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses 
Briefly, longitudinal serological responses to vaccines were measured by automated chemiluminescent ELISA to detect IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein, nucleocapsid, and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein to discriminate between vaccine-induced antibody response and convalescence from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. Scaled luminescence values were measured and converted to binding antibody units (BAU) per mL to provide a titre (appendix 2 pp 5–6).
Statistical analysis 
Participants' demographic and clinical characteristics were reported as proportions for categorical data and as means (ranges) for continuous data. All residents aged 65 years and older from the participating long-term care facilities who received two COVID-19 vaccine doses were eligible for analysis. Participants were not excluded on the basis of missing data and there was no imputation for missing data. The antibody response profiles (for spike protein, RBD, and nucleocapsid) were displayed visually. Logarithmic transformation8 was used to normalise antibody responses in BAU/mL (titres). Linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts were used to evaluate change in antibody concentrations over time, accounting for within-individual variability, and to test the interaction between change in antibody concentrations over time and vaccine type, homology, previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status, age, or the absence or presence of medical comorbidities by type of comorbidity. To determine whether previous infection status affected the antigenicity of these vaccine strategies, we separately analysed the impact of vaccine homology in individuals without and those with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To determine whether antigenicity varies with age, we categorised the age of participants in the discovery cohort into decades and assessed their serological responses. The types of comorbidities examined were cognitive impairment, cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, history of diabetes, and history of cancer. The timepoints for blood sample collection were treated as a categorical variable in the model. Our sample size had 80% statistical power to detect a medium effect size of 0·5 (approximately 22% difference in RBD and spike protein, and approximately 60% difference in nucleocapsid) based on a two-sided significance level of 0·05. The power analysis was a post-hoc analysis for a test against a null difference of log antibody concentrations. No correction for multiple comparisons was applied. Although there is no consensus threshold of protective antibody titres, a difference of 20% (log BAU/mL) in antibody concentrations would require a sample size larger than what was feasible in this observational study. None of the differences observed by age or sex exceeded 20%. Analyses were done in SAS (version 9.4).

Results 
Between Dec 31, 2020, and Feb 16, 2021, 228 (71%) of 321 eligible residents contacted by the research team agreed to participate in the study (appendix 2 p 7) and were enrolled. 14 participants were excluded because they did not receive the second vaccine dose, due to death, refusal of the second vaccine, or withdrawal from the study. An additional 29 participants were excluded because they were younger than 65 years. Thus, the total study sample consisted of 185 participants. Among these participants, the median age was 83 years (IQR 76–90), 128 (69%) were female, 166 (90%) were White, 86 (46%) had been previously diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection (confirmed by RT-PCR in the respective diagnostic laboratory), and 181 (98%) had at least one coexisting condition. The mean score on the Clinical Frailty Scale7 of the included participants was 6·57 (SD 1·03; median 7·00 [6·00–7·00], range 1–8). The first vaccine dose was mRNA-1273 (Spikevax) for 149 (81%) participants and BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) for 36 (19%) participants. The second dose was mRNA-1273 (Spikevax) for 65 (35%) participants and BNT162b2 (Comirnaty) for 120 (65%) participants. 65 participants received two doses of mRNA-1273, 36 received two doses of BNT162b2, and 84 received mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2. All recruited participants were available for follow-up at t5. Comparison of cohorts showed that the discovery cohort (n=78) and confirmatory cohort (n=107) were comparable in age, sex, race, comorbidity, frailty, and time (in days) between the first and second vaccine doses, although differences were observed in the proportion of participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccine homology; the discovery cohort had a higher proportion of participants with a previous SARS-CoV-2 infection and a higher proportion who received a heterologous prime-boost compared to the confirmatory cohort (table ). The median time between the first and second vaccine dose for all participants was 111 days (IQR 111–112; range 81–169). The median time between the first and second vaccine dose was 111 days (IQR 111–112; range 95–169) for the discovery cohort and 112 days (IQR 111–112; range 81–113) for the confirmatory cohort. The median time between the first and second vaccine dose for those who received two doses of mRNA-1273 was 112 days (IQR 112–112; range 111–169); for those who received two doses of BNT162b2 it was 96 days (IQR 95–112; range 81–113); and for those who received mRNA-1273 followed by BNT162b2 it was 111 days (IQR 111–111; range 111–137). In the discovery group, 49 (63%) of 78 participants had previous, microbiologically confirmed, natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. These statuses were reflected in the mean anti-nucleocapsid IgG concentrations at baseline (t1): 2·55 (SD 1·50) log BAU/mL for the uninfected and 4·56 (0·90) log BAU/mL for the infected; p<0·0001; figure 1 ). Those who were previously infected maintained anti-nucleocapsid reactivity over the subsequent timepoints and at higher levels than those who were previously uninfected. For the anti-spike IgG response, contrasting means were noted at t1 based on the status of previous infection: 2·73 (SD 2·66) log BAU/mL for those who were uninfected and 6·68 (1·65) log BAU/mL for those who were infected (p<0·0001). A significant increase in anti-spike IgG concentrations was seen 4 weeks after the prime dose regardless of infection status (from 4·86 [SD 1·04] log BAU/mL to 8·53 [1·14] log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and from 5·21 [1·22] log BAU/mL to 8·05 [0·95] log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG). Comparable levels were detected at t2, 4 weeks after the first dose (6·61 [SD 2·00] log BAU/mL vs 8·95 [1·80] log BAU/mL, p<0·0001) and at t3, 6–10 weeks after the first dose (6·44 [2·20] log BAU/mL vs 8·14 [2·56] log BAU/mL; p=0·0047). Notably, at t4 (16 weeks after first dose), the mean anti-spike IgG response in previously uninfected participants declined to lower levels than in those who had recovered from natural SARS-CoV-2 infection (5·84 [SD 2·49] log BAU/mL vs 8·82 [2·25] log BAU/mL; p<0·0001). This difference resolved by t5, 4 weeks after the second dose (9·01 [SD 1·25] log BAU/mL vs 9·38 [1·31] log BAU/mL; p=0·25). Anti-RBD IgG concentrations at baseline (t1) were significantly higher in previously infected individuals: 2·85 (SD 2·01) log BAU/mL in uninfected participants versus 6·04 (1·70) log BAU/mL in previously infected participants (p<0·0001). Regardless of infection status in the discovery cohort, there was a significant decline in anti-RBD and anti-spike IgG concentrations until the boost dose (7·10 log [SD 1·43] BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and 7·60 [1·20] log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG), followed by an increase 4 weeks later (9·58 [0·62] log BAU/mL for anti-RBD IgG and 9·23 [0·56] log BAU/mL for anti-spike IgG). Those who were previously infected maintained significantly higher mean anti-RBD IgG activity over the following 16 weeks (t2 to t4), compared to those who were previously uninfected, in whom concentrations declined at t4. However, by 4 weeks after boost immunisation (t5), anti-RBD IgG concentrations were comparable between the two groups. The dynamics of the anti-nucleocapsid, anti-spike, and anti-RBD IgG concentrations, starting at 4 weeks following the first dose, were confirmed in the confirmatory cohort (appendix 2 p 8), including the decline in anti-spike and anti-RBD responses at t4. In the discovery group, 49 (63%) of 78 participants had previous, microbiologically confirmed, natural SARS-CoV-2 infection. These statuses were reflected in the mean anti-nucleocapsid IgG concentrations at baseline (t1): 2·55 (SD 1·50) log BAU/mL for the uninfected and 4·56 (0·90) log BAU/mL for the infected; p<0·0001; figure 1 ). Those who were previously infected maintained anti-nucleocapsid reactivity over the subsequent timepoints and at higher levels than those who were previously uninfected.

Comparable levels were detected at t2, 4 weeks after the first dose (6·61 [SD 2·00] log BAU/mL vs 8·95 [1·80] log BAU/mL, p<0·0001) and at t3, 6–10 weeks after the first dose (6·44 [2·20] log BAU/mL vs 8·14 [2·56] log BAU/mL; p=0·0047).
