OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was therefore to verify whether the 
ROX index is an accurate predictor of HFNC failure for COVID-19 patients treated 
outside the intensive care unit (ICU) and to evaluate the validity of the 
previously suggested threshold.
DESIGN: Multicenter study. Retrospective observational analysis of prospectively 
collected data.
SETTING: 3 centres specialized in non-invasive respiratory support (Buenos 
Aires, Argentina; Bolzano and Treviso, Italy). Patients treated outside the ICU 
were analysed MEASUREMENTS: The variables to calculate the ROX index were 
collected during the first day of therapy at 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours and then 
recorded every 24 hours. HFNC failure was defined as escalation of respiratory 
support to invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death.
MAIN RESULTS: A total of 35 (29%) patients failed HFNC and required intubation. 
ROC analysis identified the 12-hour ROX index as the best predictor of 
intubation with an AUC of 0.7916[CI 95% 0.6905-0.8927] and the best threshold to 
be 5.99[Specificity 96% Sensitivity 62%]. In the survival analysis, a ROX value 
<5.99 was associated with an increased risk of failure (p = 0008 log - rank 
test). The threshold of 4,9 identified by Roca as the best predictor in 
non-COVID patients, was not able to discriminate between success and failure 
(p = 0.4 log-rank test) in our patients.
CONCLUSIONS: ROX index may be useful in guiding the clinicians in their decision 
to intubate patients, especially in patients with moderate ARF, treated 
therefore outside the ICU. Indeed, it also demonstrates a different threshold 
value than reported for non-COVID patients, possibly related to the different 
mechanisms of hypoxia.
