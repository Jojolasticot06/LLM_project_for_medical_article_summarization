OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to describe the postgraduate education trajectories 
of family and community physicians in Brazil, where neither primary healthcare 
nor family and community medicine is recognised as a knowledge area for the 
purpose of research and postgraduate education (master's and PhD degrees).
DESIGN: An observational, exploratory study, using administrative data. A 
nationwide list of family and community physicians as of late November 2018 was 
compiled from multiple sources. Data on the mode of specialisation was obtained 
from the same sources and were correlated with data on master's and PhD degrees, 
obtained from the curricula vitae on the Lattes Platform.
SETTING: This study was set in Brazil.
PARTICIPANTS: 6238 family and community physicians (58.3% female), of whom 2795 
had earned a specialist certificate (identified from the list of physicians 
certified by Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina de Fam√≠lia e Comunidade) and 3957 
had completed medical residency (identified from SisCNRM, the national 
information system for medical residency).
RESULTS: A master's degree was held by 747 (12.0%) family and community 
physicians, and a PhD by 170 (2.7%); most degrees were in collective health 
(47.0% and 42%, respectively). Men were more likely than women to hold a 
master's degree (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.24, 95% uncertainty interval (UI) 
1.07-1.45) and even more likely to a hold PhD (aOR 1.86, 95% UI 1.35-2.59). 
Family and community physicians were also less likely to hold a PhD degree if 
their master's degree was professional (oriented towards jobs outside academia) 
instead of academic (aOR 0.15, 95% UI 0.05-0.39) or in some area other than 
collective health or medicine (aOR 0.41, 95% UI 0.21-0.78, compared with a 
master's degree in collective health). The postgraduate degree was more likely 
to precede specialisation for family and community physicians specialising 
through certification (master's degree 39.9%, PhD 33%) than through medical 
residency (master's degree 9.1%, PhD 6%).
CONCLUSION: Family and community physicians in Brazil increasingly earn academic 
and professional master's and PhD degrees, with an emphasis on collective 
health, even though women seemingly face barriers to advance their education. 
The consequences of different postgraduate trajectories should be critically 
examined.
