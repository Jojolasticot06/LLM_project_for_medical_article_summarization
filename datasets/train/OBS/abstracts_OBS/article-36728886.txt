Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable 1 
pathology that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation.1 2 
According to the World Health Organization, COPD is the third highest cause of mortality 3 
worldwide in 2019.2 The evolution of COPD is not limited to respiratory symptoms: 4 
comorbidities are extremely frequent during the evolution of the disease3, and increase the 5 
impact on the quality of life of COPD patients.4 Among these comorbidities, the impairment of 6 
postural control has been described as one important extra-respiratory manifestation for these 7 
patients.5 8 

Postural control is a complex system, which manages the body’s position in space for the dual 9 
purposes of stability and orientation.6 The postural control of COPD patients has been 10 
documented by numerous experimental studies and three systematic reviews have highlighted 11 
the impairment of postural control of people with COPD compared to control participants.7–9 12 
However, the mechanisms behind and the potential consequences of postural control alteration 13 
are only partially known.8,9 14 

Pulmonary rehabilitation is one of the major treatments for people with COPD10 and consists 15 
of a comprehensive, individualised intervention based on thorough assessment of identifiable 16 
treatable traits.11,12 Exercise training and therapeutic education are considered as cornerstones 17 
of pulmonary rehabilitation and various interventions are delivered in addition to fit patient 18 
needs.12 The initial evaluation of a pulmonary rehabilitation program must be holistic to realize 19 
an overview of patient’s strengths, impairments, and project. To this purpose, a wide range of 20 
areas are assessed during this evaluation (e.g. pulmonary function, symptoms, exercise 21 
capacity, muscular function, quality of life, etc.).11 22 

The latest American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society statement on pulmonary 23 
rehabilitation recommended to include the evaluation of postural control in the initial 24 
assessment.13 However, no specific tests are recommended in the guidelines and a 25 

comprehensive assessment of postural control can be complex, time-consuming, and is not 1 
usually performed as a first-line procedure in patients with COPD.14 Although not all people 2 
with COPD have impaired postural control (an estimated 40-45% have reduced postural 3 
control15,16), identifying the characteristics and predictors of a reduced postural control could 4 
facilitate the detection and the classification of at risk-patients and thus individuals who require 5 
a comprehensive postural control assessment. In addition, exploring the correlation between 6 
postural control in COPD patients and various clinical factors could be of interest to clarify or 7 
support hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms (e.g. muscle function or dyspnea9) and 8 
impacts of postural control impairment (e.g. on activities of daily living or quality of life15). 9 

The aims of this study were 1) to identify clinical factors that characterize patients with reduced 10 
postural control, 2) to identify predictors of a reduced postural control in these patients and 3) 11 
to investigate any correlation between postural control and clinical factors in patients with 12 
COPD. 13

METHODS 15 

 16 

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTINGS 17 

This study is a secondary cross-sectional analysis of the PARACHUTE study17, conducted in 18 
the pulmonary rehabilitation unit of the Centre Hospitalier des Pays de Morlaix, from January 19 
2019 to December 2019. This study’s purpose was to determine the effect of a pulmonary 20 
rehabilitation program on fear of falling of COPD patients. This research was approved by the 21 
ethics committee of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Brest (number 29BRC18.0246) and 22 
was registered on Clinical Trials (number NCT03793452). 23 

PARTICIPANTS 2 

Inclusion criteria were as follows: patients older than 18 years old with a confirmed diagnostic 3 
of COPD stage 2 to 4 (A-D) according to the GOLD criteria.1 4 

Exclusion criteria were: (1) Patients with a diagnosed pathology impairing his balance, (2) 5 
Previous pneumonectomy or lobectomy in the past 6 months, (3) Refusal of participation, (4) 6 
Patients with an incapacity to follow a standard rehabilitation program, (5) Pregnant or breast-7 
feeding woman, (6) Patients under tutorship or curatorship. 8 

Participants participated on a four-week program in the pulmonary rehabilitation unit of the 9 
Centre Hospitalier des Pays de Morlaix. Patients were assessed at the beginning and at the end 10 
of the program. The study of the association between postural control and clinical factors was 11 
performed on baseline data. 12 


ASSESSMENTS 14 

The postural control was assessed using the Brief BESTest (BBT) which is a composite 15 
functional tool18. The BBT is a derivative of the BESTest, an assessment aiming to investigate 16 
every sub-components of postural control.19,20 The BBT explores a significant number of sub-17 
components of postural control (seven out of nine according to Sibley et al. operational 18 
definition of postural control21). The BBT is valid22 and reliable22,23 in the COPD population. 19 
Normative values were reported by O’Hoski et al.24 for people from 50 to 90 years old. 20 

Every participant realized a spirometry with Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second and Forced 21 
Vital Capacity maneuvers after bronchodilators, in accordance to international 22 
recommendations.25 23 

An arterial puncture was performed for arterial blood gases analysis to obtain the resting partial 1 
pressure of oxygen in blood (PaO2) and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in blood. 2 

Inspiratory muscle strength was obtained by assessing the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) 3 
measured using a Micro RPM (Micro Medical), following the European Respiratory Society 4 
statement on respiratory muscle testing.26 Isometric maximal voluntary quadriceps strength and 5 
quadriceps endurance were measured using a hand-held dynamometer (MicroFET 2, Hoggan), 6 
following a standardized, validated and reliable procedure.27,28 7 

Exercise capacity was measured using the six-minute walk test and the one-minute Sit to Stand 8 
test. The six-minute walk test is a self-paced walking test, which measures the distance covered 9 
by an individual over the course of six minutes. This is a valid and reliable tool for assessing 10 
exercise capacity in people with COPD.29 The one-minute Sit to Stand test assessed the ability 11 
to change from a sitting to a standing position repeatedly, for one minute. The one-minute Sit 12 
to Stand test is a relevant and reliable tool for assessing functional status of patients with 13 
COPD.30 14 

Dyspnea was evaluated in a multi-dimensional way with the Dyspnea-12 questionnaire, the 15 
Modified Medical Research Council dyspnea Scale, the London Chest Activity of Daily Living 16 
and the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (conducted at the end of the six-minute walk test). 17 
The Dyspnea-12is a questionnaire investigating the affective and sensory dimensions of the 18 
dyspnea.31 The Modified Medical Research Council is a zero-to-four scale, assessing the global 19 
impact of dyspnea in the life of patients.32 The London Chest Activity of Daily Living is a tool 20 
designed to assessed the impact of dyspnea in fifteen different activities of daily living.33 The 21 
Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile is a composite tool that assessed the affective and sensory 22 
dimension of dyspnea related to an activity.34 The Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile is 23 
separated into three different scales (“A1” and “A2” regarding affective dimension of dyspnea 24 

and “QS” regarding the sensory dimension of dyspnea). These questionnaires were validated in 1 
the COPD population and translated into French.35,36 2 

Quality of life (QoL) was measured with both the Saint George Respiratory questionnaire 3 
(SGRQ) and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). The SGRQ is a questionnaire designed to 4 
measure the impact on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being in patients with 5 
obstructive airways disease.35 The SGRQ gives three sub-scores (symptoms, activities, and 6 
impacts) and a total score. Each score is given on a 0-to-100-point scale (a higher score indicates 7 
a higher impact of the disease in the QoL of patients). The CAT is a questionnaire assessing the 8 
impact of COPD on health status.38 The CAT totals eight items, each item is scored on a 1 to 5 9 
point scale. Range of CAT scores from 0–40 where higher scores denote a more severe impact 10 
of COPD on patient life. 11 

Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale .39 It 12 
consists of 14 items, 7 for anxiety disorders and 7 for depressive disorders. Each item is scored 13 
between 0 and 3 and a score out of 21 is given for each dimension. A higher score indicates a 14 
higher risk of anxiety or depressive symptoms. 15 

Patients were asked to report falls on the twelve-month period before the inclusion in the 16 
program. Fear of falling was evaluated using the Fall Efficacy Scale-International.40 , a self-17 
administered questionnaire designed to assess the fear of falling that has been widely used in 18 
previous research in the COPD population.41,42 It consists of 16 items, scored from 1 to 4 by the 19 
patient. The total score is therefore between 16 and 64 points. A high score indicates a high fear 20 
of falling. 21 

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 23 

Descriptive data were presented as mean (± standard deviation) or as median (interquartile 1 
range) according to the nature of the variable and the distribution. The normality of the 2 
distribution was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. 3 

Using the normative values of the BBT 24, a reduction of postural control was defined by a BBT 4 
score below the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval to the mean BBT score for the 5 
decade. Thus, the participants were classified into the reduced postural control group or the 6 
non-reduced postural control group. The analysis of the differences between these two groups 7 
was performed using the independent Student t-test, the Mann-Whitney U test or the .2. The 8 
effect size for between-group differences was calculated using the Cohen’s d or the rank biserial 9 
correlation. 10 

The correlation analysis between the postural control score (BBT) and the clinical factors was 11 
performed using the Pearson correlation coefficient or the Spearman’s rank correlation 12 
coefficient. 13 

A binomial logistic regression was performed with the presence or not of a reduced postural 14 
control as the dependent variable. A forward stepwise approach was used to determine the best 15 
regression model. Independent variables were selected from the between-groups analysis and 16 
the correlation analysis. The number of independent variables selected was adapted to the 17 
sample size, using the rule of thumb of a minimum of ten participants per predictor.43 Selected 18 
independent variables were successively incorporated into the model to obtain the lowest 19 
possible Akaike Information Criterion and the higher possible Nagelneke R2. A Receiver 20 
Operating Characteristic curve was performed to evaluate the sensitivity and the specificity of 21 
the regression model. 22 

A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The statistical analysis was 23 
performed using Jamovi 1.8.1.0 (The Jamovi Project). 24

RESULTS 2 



PARTICIPANTS AND CHARACTERISTICS 4 

80 patients were consecutively included in the PARACHUTE study. Seven patients were 5 
excluded from the final analysis: four participants did not respect eligibility criteria and three 6 
did not perform the postural control assessment at baseline. Thus, a total of 73 participants were 7 
included in the analysis. The detailed characteristics of included patients are shown in the table 8 
1. 43 participants presented a reduced postural control as previously defined in study’s methods, 9 
26 participants were considered having a non-reduced postural control and four participants 10 
were not classified (no normative data available for their age decade). The between group 11 
comparison (reduced postural control versus non-reduced postural control) showed significant 12 
differences in the following clinical factors: PaO2 (P = .019 ; d = .62), SGRQ-total (P = .04 ; d 13 
= -0.75), SGRQ-Symptoms (p < .001 ; d = -0.88), SGRQ-Activities (P = .02 ; d = -0.59), SGRQ-14 
Impacts (P = .045 ; d = -0.51), CAT (P = .040 ; d = -0.52) and Anxiety score of Hospital Anxiety 15 
and Depression Scale -(P = .015 ; d = -0.63). The difference was not significant for BMI (P = 16 
.07; d = -0.45) and MIP (P = .09; d = .42). 17 


CORRELATIONS

The significant correlations between postural control (BBT score) and the clinical factors are 20 
represented in the table 2. This analysis was performed for all participants, independently of 21 
postural control status. 22 

LOGISTIC REGRESSION 1 

The logistic regression was performed to determine predictive factors for presenting a reduced 2 
postural control. The best logistic regression model included the SGRQ-Symptoms (OR =1.05: 3 
95% CI, 1.02 - 1.08, P = .003), PaO2 (OR = .93: 95% CI, .87 - .99, P = .020), MIP (OR = .96: 4 
95% CI, .93 - .99, P = .020) and BMI (OR =1.15: 95% CI, 1.01 - 1.31, P = .034). This model 5 
was the best in accordance with the a priori set criteria (Akaike Information Criterion = 69.6; 6 
Nagelneke R2 = .44). Setting the cut-off at 0.67, the model sensibility was 74% and specificity 7 
was 74%, the area under the curve was 0.84 (figure 1). 8 

The final equation is the following: 9 

P (Reduced postural control) = 2.4201 + 0.0481*SGRQ-Symptoms – 0.0771*PaO2 – 10 
0.0390*MIP+ 0.1418*BMI 11 

Where “P (reduced postural control)” is the probability of presenting a reduced postural control. 12 

The estimated marginal means for each predictor are represented in the figure 2. 13 
 

DISCUSSION


The main aim of this study was to identify clinical factors that characterized COPD patients 17 
with reduced postural control: these patients presented significantly impaired QoL scores, lower 18 
PaO2 and higher anxiety score. Secondly, the analysis of the correlation between postural 19 
control and clinical factors identified significant associations with QoL, PaO2, inspiratory 20 
muscle strength, dyspnea, exercise capacity and fear of falling. Lastly, predictive clinical factors 21 
of an impaired postural control were symptom-related QoL, PaO2, inspiratory muscle strength 1 
and BMI. 2 

Previous research has shown that postural control impairment is frequent in COPD patients.15,16 3 
In the present study, nearly six out of ten COPD patients were considered to have a reduced 4 
postural control. So, this study adds to the evidence that postural control impairment is very 5 
common in patients with COPD, and that this domain must be explored by clinicians with 6 
regard to its consequences in terms of falling 44 and performing daily tasks15. 7 

This study identified that the QoL is significantly more impaired in COPD patients with altered 8 
postural control. QoL scores were also correlated with postural control, and the symptoms sub-9 
score of the SGRQ was identified as the strongest predictor of the presence of a reduced postural 10 
control in these patients. The reduction of QoL in patients with impaired postural control and 11 
the significant correlation could suggest that postural control impairment has a negative impact 12 
on daily lives of people with COPD. However, the identification of the SGRQ-symptoms sub-13 
score as one of the predictors of a reduced postural control could implicate that the relation 14 
between these parameters is bilateral: on the one hand, it seems probable that a reduction in 15 
postural control induces an impairment in quality of life. But on the other hand, symptoms (such 16 
as dyspnea) and their perceived consequences have the potential to interact negatively with 17 
postural control, as suggested by previous research9. 18 

If some authors have hypothesized that hypoxemia could be an underlying mechanism of 19 
postural control impairment in COPD45, few studies on postural control included a direct 20 
measure of arterial blood pressure in oxygen. Ozalevli et al.46 reported a significant correlation 21 
between PaO2 and the Berg balance scale (r = .28) in patients with COPD, which is in line with 22 
the present study. According to our results, the PaO2 is also a significant predictor of the 23 
presence of a reduced postural control in COPD patients: any decrease in PaO2 increases the 24 
risk of presenting a postural control impairment in the latter. 25 

The results of this study suggest that inspiratory muscle strength could play a role in postural 1 
control impairment in COPD. The presence of a reduced inspiratory strength could increase the 2 
risk of presenting a postural control impairment in COPD patients. This is in line with previous 3 
clinical research47 and is consistent with laboratory studies that highlighted the role of 4 
inspiratory muscles in postural control function48,49. This finding is potentially important for 5 
the management of COPD patients with decreased postural control function, as inspiratory 6 
muscle training could be a relevant intervention for them. While balance training or functional 7 
exercises are the interventions with the highest level of evidence50,51, previous studies in 8 
elderly52 and in people with COPD53 have shown that inspiratory muscle training could be a 9 
potential relevant intervention for postural control enhancement 10 

Our results identified that the BMI is a significant predictor of postural control impairment in 11 
patients with COPD: in our analysis any raise in the BMI increases the risk of presenting a 12 
reduced postural control. Using a similar study design, Jacome et al. reported BMI as a 13 
significant predictor of reduced postural control with comparable odds ratio (OR =1.12 in 14 
Jacome study versus 1.16 here).16 15 

Previous studies attempted to identify predictors of reduced postural control in COPD patients: 16 
Jacome et al.16 identified BMI, number of medications, alterations in recreational activities and 17 
depression score as predictors of reduced postural control (defined by a Timed up and Go score 18 
below normative values). Liwsrisakun et al.54 found that the exercise capacity (assessed by the 19 
six-minute walk test) was the only predictor of a reduced postural control (here defined using 20 
fall risk cut-off for the Timed up and Go test and the Berg Balance Scale ). The definition of 21 
“reduced postural control” differed in these studies and the clinical factors used for logistic 22 
regression were not the same and could therefore explain the differences observed. 23 

Even if identified predictors are the result of a statistical analysis, it could be hypothesized that 24 
positive changes in these predictor scores could induce interesting modifications in postural 25 

control of COPD patients. Future studies should investigate the impact on postural control of 1 
changes in QoL, PaO2, inspiratory muscle strength or BMI. 2 


LIMITATIONS

Firstly, this is a secondary analysis of a study designed for a different purpose. It implicates that 5 
the sample size calculation was not tailor made for this purpose and that the number of included 6 
participants is small for this type of analysis. However, for logistic regression analysis, some 7 
authors suggested a sample size of ten participants per predictor,43 which is the case here. In 8 
any case, the equation needs to be validated with a larger sample size and confirmed 9 
prospectively. The second limitation is that participants were voluntary patients participating in 10 
a pulmonary rehabilitation program. This does not represent all patients with COPD and the 11 
extrapolation to the whole COPD population should be confirmed in future research with a 12 
more representative panel.


CONCLUSION

In the context of a pulmonary rehabilitation program, this study shows that COPD patients with 16 
reduced postural control present characteristics in several clinical factors that distinguish them 17 
from patients with non-impaired postural control. Symptom-related QoL, PaO2, MIP and BMI 18 
were identified as predictors of an impaired postural control in these patients. 19
