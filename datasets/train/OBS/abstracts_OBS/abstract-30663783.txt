This study aimed to investigate the spatial distribution and redistribution of 
lumbar erector spinae (ES) activity during a lumbar extension endurance task in 
pain-free participants and how this is modified in people with low back pain 
(LBP). High density surface electromyography (HDEMG) was recorded using 13 × 5 
electrode grids placed over the lumbar ES in 13 LBP and 13 control participants 
while completing an Ito test to task failure. The root mean square of the HDEMG 
signals was computed, a topographical map of the EMG amplitude generated and the 
centre of the activity (centroid) determined throughout the task. The centroid 
of the EMG amplitude map was systematically more cranial (F = 6.09, P = 0.022) 
for the LBP participants compared with the control subjects. Regression analysis 
showed that the extent of redistribution of ES activity was associated with 
longer endurance. These results show that LBP participants utilised a different 
motor strategy to perform the endurance task, characterised by greater 
activation of more cranial regions of the ES and less redistribution of ES 
activity throughout the task. This study provides new insight into the 
functional activation of the lumbar ES and how it is modified when people have 
pain.
