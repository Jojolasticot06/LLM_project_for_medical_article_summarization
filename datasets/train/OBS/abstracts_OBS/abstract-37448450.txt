Immune-responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination is reduced in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). Previous reports point to a role of mycophenolic acid (MPA). Our observational cohort study included all KTRs at University Hospital Zurich receiving two SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine doses more than 6 months post-transplantation, who were assessed by measuring anti-spike immunoglobulin G (IgG). We applied principles of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to correlate MPA exposure and lymphocyte counts with SARS-CoV-2 IgG. MPA trough levels differ largely among KTRs with a median of 3.1 mg/L (range 0.7-9.5 mg/L). 34 of 84 KTRs (40%) developed positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG after two vaccine doses. KTRs who developed positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG showed significantly higher eGFR (p < 0.001), lower MPA trough levels (p < 0.001) and higher CD19+ lymphocytes (p < 0.001). MPA trough levels <2.5 mg/l and CD19+ lymphocytes >40/Î¼l identify KTRs with seroconversion. Upon logistic regression, MPA trough levels <2.5 mg/L were associated with a 7-fold (CI 95%: 1.589-29.934) and ciclosporin use with a 6-fold (CI 95%: 1.148-30.853) increase in the odds of seroconversion. Our study indicates that immune-responsiveness to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines correlates with MPA exposure measured by MPA trough level but argues against a class effect of MPA. TDM-guided MPA dosing may be a strategy to increase seroconversion rate.
